This vulnerability allows an attacker to supply URLs that expose private data, scan the target's internal network, or compromise the target through remote code execution.

## Identify endpoints

Read your collection throughfully and search for requests that:

-   Include full URLs in the POST body or parameters
-   Include URL paths (or partial URLs) in the POST body or parameters
-   Headers that include URLs like Referer
-   Allows for user input that may result in a server retrieving resources


## SSRF types

### In-Band SSRF

A URL is specified as an attack. The request is sent and the content of your supplied URL is displayed back to you in a response.

A possible endpoint:

```
{
	"inventory":"http://store.com/api/v3/inventory/item/12345"
}
```

SSRF code:

```
{
	"inventory":"http://maliciousserver.com"
}
```


### Blind  SSRF

It's similar to In-Band attack. In this case, the response is returned and we do not have any indication that the server is vulnerable:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
headers...  
{}
```

But, there is a way to test it. Burp Suite Pro has a great tool called Burp Suite Collaborator. Collaborator can be leveraged to set up a web server that will provide us with the details of any requests that are made to our random URL.
