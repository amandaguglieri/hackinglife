## PsService

_PsService_ is a service viewer and controller for Windows. Like the SC utility that's included in the Windows NT and Windows 2000 Resource Kits, _PsService_ displays the status, configuration, and dependencies of a service, and allows you to start, stop, pause, resume and restart them. Unlike the SC utility, _PsService_ enables you to logon to a remote system using a different account, for cases when the account from which you run it doesn't have required permissions on the remote system. _PsService_ includes a unique service-search capability, which identifies active instances of a service on your network. You would use the search feature if you wanted to locate systems running DHCP servers, for instance.
