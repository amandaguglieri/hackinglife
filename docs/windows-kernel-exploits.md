# Windows: Kernel Exploits

!!! tip "Kernel exploits"
	- [Windows kernel exploits](windows-kernel-exploits.md)
	- [Linux kernel exploits](linux-kernel-exploits.md)


This [site](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability) is handy for searching out detailed information about Microsoft security vulnerabilities. This database has 4,733 security vulnerabilities entered at the time of writing, showing the massive attack surface that a Windows environment presents.

## MS08-067
`MS08-067` - This was a remote code execution vulnerability in the "Server" service due to improper handling of RPC requests. This affected Windows Server 2000, 2003, and 2008 and Windows XP and Vista and allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. Though typically encountered in client environments as a remote code execution vulnerability, we may land on a host where the SMB service is blocked via the firewall. We can use this to escalate privileges after forwarding port 445 back to our attack box. Though this is a "legacy" vulnerability, I still do see this pop up from time to time in large organizations, especially those in the medical industry who may be running specific applications that only work on older versions of Windows Server/Desktop. We should not discount older vulnerabilities even in 2021. We will run into every scenario under the sun while performing client assessments and must be ready to account for all possibilities. The box [Legacy](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2019/02/21/htb-legacy.html) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerability from the remote code execution standpoint. There are standalone as well as a Metasploit version of this exploit.


## MS17-010 (EternalBlue)
`MS17-010` - Also known as [EternalBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue) is a remote code execution vulnerability that was part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released in the [Shadow Brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers) leak. This exploit leverages a vulnerability in the SMB protocol because the SMBv1 protocol mishandles packets specially crafted by an attacker, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target host as the SYSTEM account. As with MS08-067, this vulnerability can also be leveraged as a local privilege escalation vector if we land on a host where port 445 is firewalled off. There are various versions of this exploit for the Metasploit Framework as well as standalone exploit scripts. This attack was showcased in the [Blue](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/05/11/htb-blue.html) box on Hack The Box, again from the remote standpoint.


## ALPC Task Scheduler 0-Day

`ALPC Task Scheduler 0-Day` - The ALPC endpoint method used by the Windows Task Scheduler service could be used to write arbitrary DACLs to `.job` files located in the `C:\Windows\tasks` directory. An attacker could leverage this to create a hard link to a file that the attacker controls. The exploit for this flaw used the [SchRpcSetSecurity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsch/a8172c11-a24a-4ad9-abd0-82bcf29d794d?redirectedfrom=MSDN) API function to call a print job using the XPS printer and hijack the DLL as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM via the Spooler service. An in-depth writeup is available [here](https://blog.grimm-co.com/2020/05/alpc-task-scheduler-0-day.html). The Hack The Box box [Hackback](https://snowscan.io/htb-writeup-hackback/) can be used to try out this privilege escalation exploit.

Summer of 2021 revealed a treasure trove of new Windows and Active Directory-related remote code execution and local privilege escalation flaws to the delight of penetration testers (and real-world attackers), and I'm sure groans from our hard-working colleagues on the defense side of things.


## 🐝 HiveNightmare, aka SeriosSam (CVE-2021-36934)

`CVE-2021-36934 HiveNightmare, aka SeriousSam` is a Windows 10 flaw that results in ANY user having rights to read the Windows registry and access sensitive information regardless of privilege level. Researchers quickly developed a PoC exploit to allow reading of the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry hives and create copies of them to process offline later and extract password hashes (including local admin) using a tool such as SecretsDump.py. More information about this flaw can be found [here](https://doublepulsar.com/hivenightmare-aka-serioussam-anybody-can-read-the-registry-in-windows-10-7a871c465fa5) and [this](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/HiveNightmare/raw/master/Release/HiveNightmare.exe) exploit binary can be used to create copies of the three files to our working directory.

## 🖨️ PrintNightmare

`PrintNightmare` is the nickname given to two vulnerabilities ([CVE-2021-34527](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) and [CVE-2021-1675](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675)) found in the [Print Spooler service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-prsod/7262f540-dd18-46a3-b645-8ea9b59753dc) that runs on all Windows operating systems.

##  🏊 Print Spooler 
The Print Spooler exploitation leverages the Windows Print Spooler service in conjunction with the SeImpersonatePrivilege privilege. The goal is to impersonate a SYSTEM token to escalate privileges. Tools like PrintSpoofer automate this process effectively. Below are detailed steps for exploiting this vulnerability:

[See more on PrintSpoofer](printspoofer.md).


## 🩹 Enumerating Missing Patches

The first step is looking at installed updates and attempting to find updates that may have been missed, thus, opening up an attack path for us.

**Examining Installed Updates**: We can examine the installed updates in several ways. Below are three separate commands we can use.

```powershell
PS C:\> systeminfo
PS C:\> wmic qfe list brief
PS C:\> Get-Hotfix
```

Viewing Installed Updates with WMI

```cmd-session
wmic qfe list brief
```

We can search for each KB (Microsoft Knowledge Base ID number) in the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5000808) to get a better idea of what fixes have been installed and how far behind the system may be on security updates. A search for `KB5000808` shows us that this is an update from March of 2021, which means the system is likely far behind on security updates.


## CVE-2020-0668: Windows Service Tracing

**The vulnerability in a nugshell**: Windows Service Tracing allows users to troubleshoot issues with running services and modules by generating debug information. Its parameters are configurable using the Windows registry. Setting a custom MaxFileSize value that is smaller than the size of the file prompts the file to be renamed with a `.OLD` extension when the service is triggered. This move operation is performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, and can be abused to move a file of our choosing with the help of mount points and symbolic links.

Checking Current User Privileges:

```powershell
whoami /priv
```

We will use this exploit: [https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668#](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668#):

```
# Do this in a Windows machine, where you also have installed Visual Studio. 
git clone https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668.git

# Now enter the folder and open the project by double clicking on CVE-2020-0668.sln file

# Once the project is open, build the solution. This will generate a bin folder with the following files:
CVE-2020-0668.exe
CVE-2020-0668.exe.config
CVE-2020-0668.pdb
NtApiDotNet.dll
NtApiDotNet.xml
```

At this point, we can use the exploit to create a file of our choosing in a protected folder such as C:\Windows\System32.
