Directory traversal vulnerabilities, also known as path traversal or directory climbing vulnerabilities, are a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows **unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended or authorized directory structure**. Directory traversal vulnerabilities can lead to serious data breaches and system compromises if not addressed/mitigated.
