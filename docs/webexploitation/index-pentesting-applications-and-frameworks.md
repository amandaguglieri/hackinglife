# Some other applications and frameworks

| Application                                                                 | Abuse Info                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [Axis2](https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/)                           | This can be abused similar to Tomcat. We will often actually see it sitting on top of a Tomcat installation. If we cannot get RCE via Tomcat, it is worth checking for weak/default admin credentials on Axis2. We can then upload a [webshell](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/tree/master/other/cat.aar) in the form of an AAR file (Axis2 service file). There is also a Metasploit [module](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/96224/Axis2-Upload-Exec-via-REST.html) that can assist with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Websphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_WebSphere_Application_Server) | Websphere has suffered from many different [vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-14/product_id-576/cvssscoremin-9/cvssscoremax-/IBM-Websphere-Application-Server.html) over the years. Furthermore, if we can log in to the administrative console with default credentials such as `system:manager` we can deploy a WAR file (similar to Tomcat) and gain RCE via a web shell or reverse shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)                | Elasticsearch has had its fair share of vulnerabilities as well. Though old, we have seen [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36337) before on forgotten Elasticsearch installs during an assessment for a large enterprise (and identified within 100s of pages of EyeWitness report output). Though not realistic, the Hack The Box machine [Haystack](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oGO9MEIz_tI&t=54) features Elasticsearch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Zabbix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabbix)                              | Zabbix is an open-source system and network monitoring solution that has had quite a few [vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-5667/product_id-9588/Zabbix-Zabbix.html) discovered such as SQL injection, authentication bypass, stored XSS, LDAP password disclosure, and remote code execution. Zabbix also has built-in functionality that can be abused to gain remote code execution. The HTB box [Zipper](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RLvFwiDK_F8&t=250) showcases how to use the Zabbix API to gain RCE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Nagios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios)                              | Nagios is another system and network monitoring product. Nagios has had a wide variety of issues over the years, including remote code execution, root privilege escalation, SQL injection, code injection, and stored XSS. If you come across a Nagios instance, it is worth checking for the default credentials `nagiosadmin:PASSW0RD` and fingerprinting the version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [WebLogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_WebLogic_Server)            | WebLogic is a Java EE application server. At the time of writing, it has 190 reported [CVEs](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-93/product_id-14534/Oracle-Weblogic-Server.html). There are many unauthenticated RCE exploits from 2007 up to 2021, many of which are Java Deserialization vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Wikis/Intranets                                                             | We may come across internal Wikis (such as MediaWiki), custom intranet pages, SharePoint, etc. These are worth assessing for known vulnerabilities but also searching if there is a document repository. We have run into many intranet pages (both custom and SharePoint) that had a search functionality which led to discovering valid credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [DotNetNuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNN_\(software\))                | DotNetNuke (DNN) is an open-source CMS written in C# that uses the .NET framework. It has had a few severe [issues](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2486/product_id-4306/Dotnetnuke-Dotnetnuke.html) over time, such as authentication bypass, directory traversal, stored XSS, file upload bypass, and arbitrary file download.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [vCenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCenter)                            | vCenter is often present in large organizations to manage multiple instances of ESXi. It is worth checking for weak credentials and vulnerabilities such as this [Apache Struts 2 RCE](https://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2017/4/13/vmware-vcenter-unauthenticated-rce-using-cve-2017-5638-apach.html) that scanners like Nessus do not pick up. This [unauthenticated OVA file upload](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/vmware_vcenter_uploadova_rce/) vulnerability was disclosed in early 2021, and a PoC for [CVE-2021-22005](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22005) was released during the development of this module. vCenter comes as both a Windows and a Linux appliance. If we get a shell on the Windows appliance, privilege escalation is relatively simple using JuicyPotato or similar. We have also seen vCenter already running as SYSTEM and even running as a domain admin! It can be a great foothold in the environment or be a single source of compromise. |


## Some basic hardening

|Application|Hardening Category|Discussion|
|---|---|---|
|[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/hardening-wordpress/)|Security monitoring|Use a security plugin such as [WordFence](https://www.wordfence.com/) which includes security monitoring, blocking of suspicious activity, country blocking, two-factor authentication, and more|
|[Joomla](https://docs.joomla.org/Security_Checklist/Joomla!_Setup)|Access controls|A plugin such as [AdminExile](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/adminexile/) can be used to require a secret key to log in to the Joomla admin page such as `http://joomla.inlanefreight.local/administrator?thisismysecretkey`|
|[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/security-in-drupal)|Access controls|Disable, hide, or move the [admin login page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/managing-users/hide-user-login)|
|[Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/security-howto.html)|Access controls|Limit access to the Tomcat Manager and Host-Manager applications to only localhost. If these must be exposed externally, enforce IP whitelisting and set a very strong password and non-standard username.|
|[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/securing-jenkins/)|Access controls|Configure permissions using the [Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth)|
|[Splunk](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.2/Security/Hardeningstandards)|Regular updates|Make sure to change the default password and ensure that Splunk is properly licensed to enforce authentication|
|[PRTG Network Monitor](https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/61108-what-security-features-does-prtg-include)|Secure authentication|Make sure to stay up-to-date and change the default PRTG password|
|osTicket|Access controls|Limit access from the internet if possible|
|[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/)|Secure authentication|Enforce sign-up restrictions such as requiring admin approval for new sign-ups, configuring allowed and denied domains|
