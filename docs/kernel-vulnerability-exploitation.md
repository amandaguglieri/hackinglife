# Kernel vulnerability exploitation

Privilege escalation using a kernel exploit can be as simple as downloading, compiling, and running it. Some of these exploits work out of the box, while others require modification. A quick way to identify exploits is to issue the command `uname -a` and search Google for the kernel version.

```bash
uname -a
cat /etc/lsb-release 
```
