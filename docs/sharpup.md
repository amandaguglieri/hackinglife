# Sharpup (by Ghostpack)

SharpUp is a C# port of various [PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) functionality. Currently, only the most common checks have been ported; no weaponization functions have yet been implemented.


Install from: [https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp)

However, in my case I have forked a repo with the combined binaries at [https://github.com/amandaguglieri/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries](https://github.com/amandaguglieri/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries).
