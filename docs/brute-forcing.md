| `Simple Brute Force`      | Systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a defined character set and length range.                 | Trying all combinations of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' for passwords of length 4 to 6.                                                             | No prior information about the password is available, and computational resources are abundant.                                             |
| `Dictionary Attack`       | Uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords.                                                             | Trying passwords from a list like 'rockyou.txt' against a login form.                                                                                    | The target will likely use a weak or easily guessable password based on common patterns.                                                    |
| `Hybrid Attack`           | Combines elements of simple brute force and dictionary attacks, often appending or prepending characters to dictionary words. | Adding numbers or special characters to the end of words from a dictionary list.                                                                         | The target might use a slightly modified version of a common password.                                                                      |
| `Credential Stuffing`     | Leverages leaked credentials from one service to attempt access to other services, assuming users reuse passwords.            | Using a list of usernames and passwords leaked from a data breach to try logging into various online accounts.                                           | A large set of leaked credentials is available, and the target is suspected of reusing passwords across multiple services.                  |
| `Password Spraying`       | Attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames.                                          | Trying passwords like 'password123' or 'qwerty' against all usernames in an organization.                                                                | Account lockout policies are in place, and the attacker aims to avoid detection by spreading attempts across multiple accounts.             |
| `Rainbow Table Attack`    | Uses pre-computed tables of password hashes to reverse hashes and recover plaintext passwords quickly.                        | Pre-computing hashes for all possible passwords of a certain length and character set, then comparing captured hashes against the table to find matches. | A large number of password hashes need to be cracked, and storage space for the rainbow tables is available.                                |
| `Reverse Brute Force`     | Targets a single password against multiple usernames, often used in conjunction with credential stuffing attacks.             | Using a leaked password from one service to try logging into multiple accounts with different usernames.                                                 | A strong suspicion exists that a particular password is being reused across multiple accounts.                                              |
| `Distributed Brute Force` | Distributes the brute forcing workload across multiple computers or devices to accelerate the process.                        | Using a cluster of computers to perform a brute-force attack significantly increases the number of combinations that can be tried per second.            | The target password or key is highly complex, and a single machine lacks the computational power to crack it within a reasonable timeframe. |
