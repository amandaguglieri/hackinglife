# Pentesting Splunk

Splunk is a log analytics tool used to gather, analyze and visualize data. Though not originally intended to be a SIEM tool, Splunk is often used for security monitoring and business analytics.

The biggest focus of Splunk during an assessment would be weak or null authentication because admin access to Splunk gives us the ability to deploy custom applications that can be used to quickly compromise a Splunk server.

Splunk is prevalent in internal networks and often runs as root on Linux or SYSTEM on Windows systems.

The Splunk web server runs by default on port 8000. Port 8089 is the Splunk management port for communication with the Splunk REST API.

On older versions of Splunk, the default credentials are `admin:changeme`, which are conveniently displayed on the login page. If the default credentials do not work, it is worth checking for common weak passwords such as `admin`, `Welcome`, `Welcome1`, `Password123`, etc.


> The Splunk Enterprise trial converts to a free version after 60 days, which doesn’t require authentication. It is not uncommon for system administrators to install a trial of Splunk to test it out, which is subsequently forgotten about. This will automatically convert to the free version that does not have any form of authentication, introducing a security hole in the environment.


Splunk has multiple ways of running code, such as server-side Django applications, REST endpoints, scripted inputs, and alerting scripts.

A common method of gaining remote code execution on a Splunk server is through the use of a scripted input.

As Splunk can be installed on Windows or Linux hosts, scripted inputs can be created to run Bash, PowerShell, or Batch scripts. Also, every Splunk installation comes with Python installed, so Python scripts can be run on any Splunk system.
