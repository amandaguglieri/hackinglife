# Pentesting Browsers


## Dumping memory and cache: focus on credentials

Firefox stored credentials:

```bash
ls -l .mozilla/firefox/ | grep default 

cat .mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx/logins.json | jq .
```

The tool [Firefox Decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) is excellent for decrypting these credentials, and is updated regularly. It requires Python 3.9 to run the latest version. Otherwise, `Firefox Decrypt 0.7.0` with Python 2 must be used.


## Dumping data from session, local data and others

[HackBrowserData](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData):  HackBrowserData is a command-line tool for decrypting and exporting browser data (passwords, history, cookies, bookmarks, credit cards, download history, localStorage and extensions) from the browser. It supports the most popular browsers on the market and runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.
