# 14147 - 14148 Filezilla

```
# Display Active Network Connections
netstat -ano
```

The main thing to look for with Active Network Connections are entries listening on loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1` and `::1`) that are not listening on the IP Address (`10.129.43.8`) or broadcast (`0.0.0.0`, `::/0`).

If we see  port `14147`, which is used for FileZilla's administrative interface, we could connect to this port, and possibly extract FTP passwords in addition to creating an FTP Share at c:\ as the FileZilla Server user (potentially Administrator).
